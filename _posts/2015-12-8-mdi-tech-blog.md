## MD Insider Tech Blog ##

Greetings from Silicon Beach!

We here at MD Insider are looking forward to sharing our journey with you as we endeavor
to create products and technologies that we hope will change how patients find doctors.

### Some Background ###

The signal to noise ratio a patient experiences when looking for a physician to treat a condition is understandably low.
There isn't a great deal of actionable, factual data available to consumers that represents the body of work actually
performed by a doctor.

What do I mean by this?

Today if you were to look for information about a physician who could perform knee replacement surgery on you - how would you go about it?

Google?

Yelp?

A family friend?

Even if you go one of those routes and obtain some recommendations, the information presented is invariably subjective.

That's where MD Insider comes in. We are using big data - crunching billions upon billions of data points - to create
insights into doctors' real world experiences. It is precisely these insights that we make available to our community of users.

### How Are We Doing It? ###

* We have built an agile team of incredibly talented folks who are passionate about the transparency space.

* We employ technologies such as [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org), [Spark](http://spark.apache.org) and [Akka](http://akka.io).

* Our polyglot team uses [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org), [Python](https://www.python.org), [R](https://www.r-project.org) and
[Angular](https://angularjs.org) to craft our best-in-class solutions.

* We are steeped in [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and statistical analysis on a daily basis.

* And no effort would be complete without automation, automation, automation.

In short, there is a LOT going on.


### The Future ###

We are working on challenging and interesting problems that take out-of-the-box thinking to find solutions for. This blog
will be a resultant byproduct of that creativity.

We hope to hear from you in the comments - please do participate!
