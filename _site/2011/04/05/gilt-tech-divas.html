  <div class="content">
    <p>So far, the blog has been focusing on all the amazing work that goes on in Gilt Technologie, but we’d like to take a moment to write about something that makes working at Gilt truly great.  The people.  Specifically, the women.  ;-) <br/><br/>Here’s a glimpse into our fabulously diverse tech team by those of us brave enough to step up and say, “Hello world.” (Rock on Gilt Tech Divas!)<br/><br/><strong>Janice E. Bouley, Corp IT Support</strong><br/>Janice supports all aspects of software, hardware, computer-related issues, IP and cell phone issues, and helps to make sure everyone at our company can work smoothly from day to day.  She also supports all of our Gilt City locations and Jetsetter and does remote help and phone support.<br/><br/>When Janice is not at Gilt she enjoys traveling, partying, and doing art.  Her favorite place to travel so far has been Beijing, China, as she loves the culture, the food, and the sites!  Janice enjoys painting, drawing, graphic design, and printmaking, especially etching and photolithography.<br/><br/><strong>Sasha Villanueva, Executive Assistant to the CIO and CTO</strong><br/>Sasha was in the first 20 hires here at Gilt.  When she first started she was in the Marketing department, which at the time only consisted of 2 people.  From Marketing, Sasha started working with Michael Bryzek, where she was able to wear multiple hats in the office and distribution centers.  Currently Sasha is the admin for the technical department where she organizes all of the department’s logistics.<br/><br/>Sasha enjoys dance and travel, and was part of a semi-pro Salsa dance team that performed all over the country.<br/><br/><strong>Molly Sullan, QA Manager</strong><br/>Molly is QA Manager at Gilt, focusing on front end, mobile, marketing, business operations and PMO projects. Her team includes both on- and offshore testers, which has been fun and challenging. Molly coordinates their testing schedules, and works with the engineering team to resolve any issues that arise. We have releases almost daily, so there is always quite a bit of new code to look through - never a dull moment!  At her desk you’ll find a collection of My Little Ponies… which has been nicknamed “The Ranch.”<br/><br/>Before joining Gilt, Molly spent a year backpacking through South America and being a ski bum in Aspen, CO. She spends her non-Gilt time skiing, hiking, playing soccer and being outside.  <br/><br/><strong>Tracie Cheung, Project Manager</strong><br/>Tracie is a project manager at Gilt and has worked on projects from enabling drop ship to launching the Gilt Manual. There is rarely a dull moment in the work day and the days rarely ever look the same. While not working, Tracie can be found poring over fashion magazines and blogs. She enjoys trying her hand at new recipes, photography, reading books, running, volleyball and amazing coffee houses in NYC.<br/><br/>In high school, Tracie’s volleyball coach misspelled her last name on the team roster to “Chenug” and to this day some of her closest friends still refer to her as “Chenug” (which is much more fun to say than to read!)<br/><br/><strong>Kristen McGregor, Software Engineer</strong><br/>Kristen works on the engineering team at Gilt City coding both the front and backend for Gilt City and our Admin. She recently worked on the new admin calendar, and is currently working on a Gilt City redesign. Kristen loves the many components of the Gilt code, where she can work in Javascript one day and switch to a Postgres SQL statement the next.<br/><br/>Kristen was born in California, grew up in Maine, and spent a few years living in San Antonio, TX.  She just recently moved to the big apple from Boston.  Kristen has had a bowl of ice cream every night since Junior High, and she considers herself a french fry connoisseur!  In her spare time Kristen enjoys fine dining in NYC, reading, skiing in the winter, long walks in the summer, and yes, coding :).<br/><br/><strong>Angela Monaghan, Project Manager</strong><br/>Angela spends her time at Gilt working on Distribution, Reporting, Gilt MANual, and Email projects! Prior to Gilt, Angela worked at eFashion Solutions as the Tech Project Manager and the Director of Photo Studio Operations. During her time at eFashion Solutions, she managed the launch of nine e-commerce sites and the daily operations of twenty-two e-commerce sites.  <br/> <br/>Angela has an unhealthy addiction to Starbucks; you will rarely see her without a coffee in her hand.  Angela spends most of her non-Gilt time working off the extra Starbucks calories in a kickboxing class or snowboarding!<br/><br/><strong>Heather Fleming, PMO Director</strong><br/>Heather spends her day coordinating the various people and projects needed for Gilt while working to improve efficiency in communication and processes.  She is passionate about organizational culture and emotional intelligence and how these contribute to the overall success of an organization.<br/><br/>When not at Gilt, you can usually find Heather on the LIRR (her commute is 2 hours one-way!).  In her free time, Heather is typically chasing after a toddler, training for a 5K and studying everything there is to know about wine… especially touring and tasting on the North Fork of Long Island.<br/><br/></p>
