<p id="docs-internal-guid--46e3ffc-5002-044d-7d7e-339e687cd082"><strong>What’s your role at Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>I’m a software engineer who focuses mostly on front-end development, but as time goes on I’m becoming more of a full-stack engineer. My passion is front-end engineering, though&ndash;I’m most comfortable working in JavaScript and CSS.</span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;m very focused on the visual side&ndash;it&rsquo;s what I like to do. I’m not the type who figures out how to design a database. I’m more interested in the interactive, &ldquo;what people see&rdquo; part.</span></p>
<p><strong>How did you arrive at Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>I’d been a member and shopped on the site for a while. I knew that Gilt’s Tech team was well respected, so when a recruiter contacted me I came in and interviewed, and that was that. That was in May 2010&ndash;right around the time that we started migrating our services from Ruby to Java.</span></p>
<p><strong>When did you become interested in technology?</strong></p>
<p><span>I studied computer science in college, but it was mostly all theory. When I came home one summer, I started making a website for myself. It was old-school: black with stars, and with that “under construction” gif of the man who makes the digging motion. The concept of online guest books was still somewhat new, and I found one that you could really customize; I found images of 3-D comic book characters and made it so that guests could pick one of the characters as their avatar. It was a big hit with people. That was my first foray into theming and changing things.</span><br/><img alt="http://www.animatedgif.net/underconstruction/5consbar2_e0.gif" class="decoded" src="http://www.animatedgif.net/underconstruction/5consbar2_e0.gif"/></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid--46e3ffc-5004-1235-f8bf-239e76caa8a3"><strong>What was the focus of the website?</strong></p>
<p><span>It was about me&ndash;teenager stuff, music I listened to. Nothing I’d want to publicize now!</span></p>
<p><strong>How did you learn front-end development?</strong></p>
<p><span>On my own. Around the time I graduated from college in 2000, I became really interested in CSS&ndash;it was just emerging. Right out of school, I started working at Razorfish as an associate technologist, using mostly Java. Even then, I found that I was more interested in trying to make things look pretty than in the straight coding part.</span></p>
<p><strong>And then the tech industry tanked.</strong></p>
<p><span>Yes, and there were no jobs to be found, especially for new college grads. I thought, ‘what should I do so that I can always have a job? Maybe I’ll become a doctor.’ I started taking pre-med classes and even got accepted into medical school, but then the tech industry started to bounce back, and I was able to find a job. That was at Wiley, and was my first front-end position.</span></p>
<p><strong>How did you bring yourself up to speed for that job?</strong></p>
<p><span>Lots of practicing at home, and mostly learning on the job. I Googled my way through it. I had the confidence because it was the passion that drove me. I loved doing front-end development, and felt like I could do it.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, JavaScript applies a lot of the same programming concepts as Java, so adapting was mainly a matter of learning the new syntax and some best practices. By the time I got to Gilt, I was much more advanced.</span></p>
<p><strong>How has working at Gilt shaped your knowledge and expertise?</strong></p>
<p><span>It&rsquo;s a very challenging environment. In any other company, people might take the easy way. Here, we do things the challenging way. We’re very stringent on coding practices: For example, people will hound you if you use a double quote instead of a single quote.</span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;ve been pushed intellectually here. When I first arrived, I hadn’t programmed in Java for years, but for one of my first Gilt projects I had to dive in and write a Java dispatcher. I was like, “what?” But I had to do it, so I just did it.</span></p>
<p><strong>How much of your work involves Scala?</strong></p>
<p><span>I’m doing some Scala programming, but not much. I took the <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/06/20/sign-up-for-free-scala-training-at-gilt" target="_blank">free Scala course</a> here and know very basic Scala syntax&ndash;though enough to know that it’s definitely prettier and more concise than Java. Functional programming is not what I studied in college, but I feel I should dive in and do it&ndash;so I have been, more and more. I&rsquo;ve been getting lots of code reviews and corrections. You just have to use your peers as guides to learn new things.</span></p>
<p><strong>Recently you and your team lead [Lead Software Engineer Kristen McGregor] spent an intensive few weeks at Mobile Bootcamp, learning iOS programming with our Mobile team. How did you get chosen for that?</strong></p>
<p><span>I volunteered! I asked Kristen if I could do it, and we both did it.</span></p>
<p><strong>What was it like to work with a different team?</strong></p>
<p><span>It was very easy, actually. The team did a one-day orientation for us, and Evan [Maloney, Mobile Principal Software Engineer] gave a presentation on what mobile is, and how to develop for it.</span></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid--46e3ffc-5005-7fac-71b9-01dc5b86dd1a"><strong>What did you learn at Bootcamp?</strong></p>
<p><span>Well, first of all, I gained a new appreciation of how iOS development is completely different from web development. It reminds me in some ways of 1990s-era web development! I learned how our apps are created, and more about the proprietary issues involved in iOS. Since Bootcamp ended I&rsquo;ve begun a side project with Ruxy [Staicut, mobile software engineer], who’s become my mentor. It&rsquo;s an app that uses our API. I&rsquo;m learning a lot that way.</span></p>
<p><strong>How does your mentoring relationship with Ruxy work?</strong></p>
<p><span>We&rsquo;ve been having weekly, one-hour meetings. At first, we mainly talked about my app and which steps to take, but last week we started coding together; it was very hands-on, and worked really well. She’ll give me tips and show me where to find things like Objective-C tutorials.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are your goals for the next few months?</strong></p>
<p><span>I recently decided that I want to be more involved in Mobile, which coincides with our shifting focus to mobile. A few weeks ago I attended the <a href="http://aneventapart.com/" target="_blank">An Event Apart</a> conference, which was all about &ldquo;mobile first&rdquo;&ndash;and it sold me on the idea. That conference used to be more about front-end development, but now it&rsquo;s pretty UX-focused. My takeaway was that multi-device compatibility is the wave of the future; you should be able to see a website on any device.</span></p>
<p><span>By going to Mobile Bootcamp, by having an iOS developer as my mentor, and by working on this responsive design project, I’m hoping to help get Gilt on the road to Mobile First and to inspire other engineers to join me.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are some of your hobbies?</strong></p>
<p><span>Videography, photography &hellip; I like to photograph people.</span></p>
<p><strong>Street fashion?</strong></p>
<p><span>A few years ago I did it a lot. Not so much anymore.</span></p>
<p><strong>You&rsquo;re a fashion aficionado. How has working at Gilt changed your approach to style?</strong></p>
<p><span>Nowadays I am concerned with classic pieces that will last&ndash;quality over quantity. I like 3.1 Philip Lim and Rag &amp; Bone, and recently bought a pair of Elizabeth and James shoes and an Antik Batik dress that are my current favorites. I like that in this office you can wear fancy things and people don’t look at you funny. I like dressing up for work!</span></p>

  <div class="content">
    <p><em><strong>&ldquo;Correlation doesn&rsquo;t imply causation, but it does waggle its eyebrows suggestively and gesture furtively while mouthing &lsquo;look over there.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br/></strong></em></p>
<p>I was intrigued by this gem of statistical poetry, which Lifehacker writer Eric Ravenscraft quotes in his great new article, &ldquo;<a href="http://lifehacker.com/imo-the-number-one-statistical-fallacy-and-one-you-do-917154313" target="_blank">Four Common Statistical Misconceptions You Should Avoid</a>.&rdquo; I had not heard the quote before. (Eric attributes it to a well-known <a href="http://xkcd.com/552/" title="xkcd Correlation strip" target="_blank">xkcd correlation strip</a>, but it&rsquo;s not in the picture: mouse over an image, and the wisdom will reveal itself.)</p>
<p>Eric&rsquo;s article made me think about other common fallacies to add to his list&ndash;including one that I call &ldquo;<strong>misdirected statistical rigor</strong>.&rdquo; It strikes when misunderstood, dirty and/or poorly collected data is run through the paces of statistical analysis and then either misinterpreted or not interpreted at all. A couple of jokes to illustrate:</p>
<ul><li>Statistical analysis of Internet adoption in rural areas has shown a very high level of Internet usage. The data was collected via web survey (aka self-selection bias).</li>
<li>From an unknown (at least to me) author: &ldquo;According to the Institute of Incomplete Research, 9 out of 10&hellip;&rdquo; Replace &ldquo;9 out of 10&rdquo; with &ldquo;f-value is decent,&rdquo; or &ldquo;kappa is looking good today,&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll realize that the Institute of Incomplete Research has a huge alumni base.</li>
</ul><p>What are your favorite statistical (or analytical) misconceptions? Or anti-patterns, if you are into that kind of thing?</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p><span><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/84474f57616b3edfb40a0108a720d7ce/tumblr_inline_mqve5cwoUp1qz4rgp.jpg" width="800"/></span></p>
<p><span>Earlier this year I began working through Satnam Alag&rsquo;s </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Collective-Intelligence-Action-Satnam-Alag/dp/B00AK4ECRI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375463624&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=collective+intelligence+in+action" target="_blank"><em>Collective Intelligence in Action</em></a><span>, a book on alligator farming. I wanted to improve my understanding of alligator farming as well as the fundamentals of data collection and mining for personalization. My work at Gilt has recently taken me in these directions, and I’d heard that this book provided a thorough overview of the topic. I’d dedicate a couple of hours every weekend to my reading, enjoying the time to learn at my own pace. But soon the weather got nicer, and I started spending more and more of my free time on the soccer field (or preparing for my soon-to-be-born twin daughters, who have since arrived). Eventually, as I got about halfway through the book, I realized that I was spending almost no time reading it and it started to collect virtual dust.</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, my colleagues at Gilt began having more serious and frequent conversations about how to provide training and learning experiences for engineers. Many of these conversations focused on very direct, structured training, such as on-site classes, tech talks, online courses, and conferences. Structured learning time such as this is extremely valuable, but there is a strong case to be made for a company to also invest in unstructured learning time for their creative talent. </span></p>
<p><span>In his 2012 book </span><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-20%25-Doctrine-Tinkering-Breaking/dp/0062003232/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375463236&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=20%25+doctrine" target="_blank">The 20% Doctrine: How Tinkering, Goofing Off, and Breaking the Rules at Work Drive Success in Business</a></em><span>, </span><em>Wired </em><span>writer Ryan Tate describes the efforts of companies like Google to inspire innovation by letting employees devote 20 percent of their time to unstructured/personal projects. As Tate’s book articulates, the 20% time allotment “</span><span>is about goofing off at work, and how that goofing off can drive innovation and profit.&ldquo; Just at Google alone, &rdquo;[t]he fruits of 20 percent time include the contextual advertising system AdSense, which is Google&rsquo;s second most profitable business line, as well as Gmail,&ldquo; Tate writes. &quot;Twenty percent time also resulted in Google News, Google Reader, the Orkut social network, Google Suggest, and Google Moderator, among others.&rdquo;<br/></span></p>
<p><span>As a supporter of the 20 Percent doctrine, I wanted to create something that would encourage unstructured learning for the moonlighting autodidact and the noodler&ndash;those of us who prefer unstructured self-learning and who have maybe made it halfway through books on collective intelligence before planning to become parents (and whatnot). So I organized <strong>Study@4</strong>: a Friday afternoon study hall at Gilt HQ that’s pretty similar to your basic high school study hall except with music, beer, snacks, and fewer rules. Study@4 is scheduled opposite our popular, biweekly <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/post/3291537111/the-friday-5-5" target="_blank">5@4 talks</a> that Gilt engineers have been organizing for years.</span></p>
<p><span>How I hope Gilt engineers will spend their Study@4s:</span></p>
<ul><li>
<p><span>reading</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>working through a tutorial</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>working on a side-project or an open source project</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>reading literary classics is also okay, I suppose </span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><span>Every Study@4 will feature a resident on duty&ndash;someone who offers personalized guidance on issues related to their expertise, and who can also recommend reading and viewing materials. This person might be an engineer who helps peers resolve coding problems, a project manager who can help an engineer structure a task, a copywriter who offers assistance with a blog post or presentation, or anyone else who is part of the Gilt Tech world. </span></p>
<p><span>You might be wondering why something like Study@4 is useful when you can study from your desk, or on the subway, or while driving down the FDR, or in the shower. But how often to we actually use those times to study? I am the type of person who gets caught up in the day to day, and I forget to take time to turn my attention over to my curiosity. If you are like me, then something like Study@4 can be a great opportunity to have an hour or two of quiet time to work on a non-urgent yet rewarding task. Study@4 is meant to be informal, and participation is completely optional.</span></p>
<p><span>We just kicked off Study@4 and we’re excited to see how it changes and grows to suit the needs of Gilt Tech’s noodlers and experimenters. I hope it becomes as popular as the 5@4 presentations and that our remote offices can find ways to benefit from what is, in many ways, a big experiment from a humble noodler who wants a chance to finish an interesting book on alligator farming.</span></p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/08/01/rock-your-doc-with-groc-our-favorite-automated">Rock Your Doc With Groc, Our Favorite Automated Frontend Documentation Tool</a></h1>
  
  <header>

  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Writing great documentation is not something that comes naturally or easily to many engineers. And many companies don’t have the resources to hire a dedicated document writer. Hence the value of automated documentation, which allows you to generate, at a minimum, a basic amount of documentation quickly and cheaply.</p>
<p>As a front-end engineer working on UI architecture, I write code that ends up being used by most of the front-end engineers at Gilt—which makes automated documentation pretty important to me. A few years ago, some of my colleagues and I checked out a variety of automated documentation tools, including <a href="http://usejsdoc.org/" target="_blank">JSDoc</a>, <a href="http://jgrouse.com/" target="_blank">jGrouseDoc</a>, <a href="http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/" target="_blank">YUIDoc</a>, <a href="http://javascriptmvc.com/docs/DocumentJS.html" target="_blank">DocumentJS</a>, and <a href="http://jashkenas.github.io/docco/" target="_blank">Docco</a>, to see if any of them both looked pretty and supported <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/index-137868.html#format" target="_new">JavaDoc-style Tags</a>. We liked Docco’s clean look, inclusion of source code alongside documentation, and acceptance of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_new">markdown</a>, but it didn’t support Tags. JSDoc supports Tags, but we didn’t like its appearance. We just couldn’t find a tool that gave us everything we needed. In the end, we created our own automated documentation tool by forking Docco and adding (<em>hacking</em>) support for Tags.</p>
<p>More recently, we conducted another survey of automated documentation tools and discovered <a href="http://nevir.github.io/groc/" target="_blank">Groc</a>. Created by Ian MacLeod, Groc is a fork of Docco, and better than the alternatives in many ways. But Groc, like its grandparent Docco, offers no support for Tags—or block comments (WTF?)<span>—</span><span>so we forked it, too,</span><span> and added (without hacking, this time) what we felt was missing. The end result is awesome. Go </span><a href="https://github.com/gilt/groc" target="_blank">check it out</a><span> on GitHub.</span></p>
<h3>But wait—what are these “Tags&quot; you speak of?</h3>
<p>You’ve probably seen Tags in block comments. They begin with an @ sign—for example, <code>@public</code> or <code>@method foo</code> or <code>@param {String[]} names A list of names</code>.</p>
<p>A doc comment usually has multiple Tags as well as some free-form text, like this:</p>
<pre><code>/**
 * Sets a cookie given a value of any type.
 *
 * @method    set
 * @public
 *
 * @param     {String}   name               The name of the cookie to be set
 * @param     {Mixed}    value              The value to convert to string and set in the cookie
 * @param     {Object}   [options]          Options hash
 * @param     {Mixed}    [options.expires]  The expiration as a number of seconds, or "session", or undefined for one year
 *
 * @return    {Boolean}                     Whether or not the cookie was successfully set
 *
 * @example
 *   cookie.set('foo', 'bar', { expires : 1000000 });
 *   cookie.set('foo', [1, 2, 3], { expires : 'session' });
 *   cookie.set('foo', { bar : 'baz', boom : 'boosh' });
 */
</code></pre>
<p>The structure that Tags provide makes writing documentation much easier for people who aren’t that great at it. The above sample is pretty decent; if we process it using Groc (our fork), we get something even better:</p>
<p><a href="http://31.media.tumblr.com/491f0cae2c43249f42972130ea84194a/tumblr_mqtbhxY9RB1scg9z6o2_1280.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/6d97c3c0c591e8bbbe7f8f970f8aaff1/tumblr_inline_mqpe3ijaM21qz4rgp.png"/></a></p>
<h3>Documenting JavaScript is nice, but what about CSS? Or Handlebars?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! I don’t have any <em>amazing</em> examples of CSS/LESS/Handlebars documentation, but it should work exactly the same as for JS/CoffeeScript. Also, you don’t <strong>have</strong> to use Tags. Here’s a Handlebars template that includes some “ordinary&quot; comments:</p>
<p><a href="http://31.media.tumblr.com/b19582ac1874f377abffe828d74989ef/tumblr_mqtbhxY9RB1scg9z6o4_1280.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/b19582ac1874f377abffe828d74989ef/tumblr_inline_mqtbvhYclW1qz4rgp.png"/></a></p>
<h3>OK, that’s cool. But you said something about <em>automating</em> this?</h3>
<p>Having a tool that can generate documentation is all well and good, but you have to remember to actually run the tool. There’s always the risk of forgetting this step. So how about we integrate it into your build process?</p>
<p>Let’s assume you use <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/" target="_blank">Grunt</a>, a front-end build tool that has a configuration file (<em>Gruntfile.coffee</em>) that enables us to define tasks. (Alternatives to Grunt include Smoosh, Gear and <a href="http://buildr.apache.org/" target="_blank">Buildr</a>.) Let’s create a custom task &ldquo;<strong>doc</strong>”:</p>
<pre><code>grunt.registerTask 'doc', 'Generate documentation', -&gt;
  done = this.async()
  grunt.log.writeln('Generating Documentation...')
  require('child_process').spawn('./node_modules/.bin/groc', ['lib/*.js', 'README.md']).on 'exit', -&gt;
    grunt.log.writeln('...done!')
    done()
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s integrate <strong>doc</strong> into our build task:</p>
<pre><code>grunt.registerTask 'build', ['test', 'clean:build', 'doc', 'concat', 'replace', 'uglify']
</code></pre>
<p>Then, whenever you <code>grunt build</code>, you get freshly generated documentation!</p>
<h3>How do you guys use this at Gilt?</h3>
<p>We have lots of small JS/CSS modules at Gilt, and they all get published to one place: a private <a href="https://npmjs.org/" target="_blank">npm</a> registry. Our documentation server uses Groc to generate documentation for all modules that get published. Both Groc and this server use the same stylesheets, so they look the same and provides a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Here’s our Table of Contents, generated by our documentation server, which lists all modules, their descriptions, current versions, code coverage percentages (courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul" target="_blank">Istanbul</a>), dependencies, and has links to the groc-generated documentation (including past versions):</p>
<p><a href="http://31.media.tumblr.com/b57d7b644650c4ff9af8880e18b67c33/tumblr_mqtbhxY9RB1scg9z6o1_1280.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/b57d7b644650c4ff9af8880e18b67c33/tumblr_inline_mqtbkvZqYx1qz4rgp.png"/></a></p>
<p>And a sample of what Groc generates:</p>
<p><a href="http://31.media.tumblr.com/c9e0dcdd349c224353995bef8a12aa44/tumblr_mqtbhxY9RB1scg9z6o3_1280.png" target="_blank"><img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/4ff7edd5a18ffa6a16c2017382d5bcdb/tumblr_inline_mqpf5c7vSP1qz4rgp.png"/></a></p>
<h3>What comes next?</h3>
<p>We’ll continue to tweak Groc to add coverage to our automated documentation tool and show which lines of code have been tested or not. We’d also like to build in a search feature that will access multiple modules. Have some suggestions on other features we should add? Email me at kdavis at gilt dot com. I’d also like to hear from anyone who uses our work—let us know if it was helpful.</p>

<p>Earlier this week we became co-organizers and sponsors of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-iOS-Office-Hours/" target="_blank">iOS Office Hours</a>: a bimonthly, two-hour meetup for folks seeking help with iOS and Objective-C programming. Created by the team at <a href="https://twitter.com/codecoalition" target="_blank">Code Coalition</a> (they&rsquo;re changing their name from <a href="http://bitfountaincode.com/" target="_blank">BitFountain</a>), iOS Office Hours began meeting in March 2013 and quickly outgrew its meeting space. Office Hours founders Eliot Arntz and Teddy Wyly teach iOS workshops at the <a href="http://betabeat.com/2012/09/kanye-west-general-assembly-startup-nyc-flatiron-cruel-summer/" target="_blank">Kanye-approved</a> learning center <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/" target="_blank">General Assembly </a>and have taught programming in underserved communities. We&rsquo;re excited to work with them!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be kicking off our partnership with a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-iOS-Office-Hours/events/132368172/" target="_blank">Tue 8/13 meetup</a> featuring short talks by Gilt Principal Software Engineer Evan Maloney and members of the Code Coalition crew, followed by casual Q&amp;A with resident experts from both companies. Bring your laptop and your questions about iPhone development, and we&rsquo;ll help you try to solve your latest development problems. All skill levels are welcome.</p>

<p>In Boston for <a href="http://backboneconf.com" target="_blank">BackboneConf</a>? Be sure to check out &ldquo;The Geologic Time Scale of Gilt.com&rsquo;s View Layer,&rdquo; the presentation that Gilt Lead Software Engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/markwunsch" target="_blank">Mark Wunsch</a> will give today (7/31) at 3 PM EST. The details on Mark&rsquo;s talk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;best practices of architecting, designing, and managing the V in MVC have evolved over the course of time. The act of modernizing a web application reveals the layers of previous approaches lurking just underneath the crust. This talk will dive through the strata of the View layer of Gilt.com. Every day, Gilt builds a dynamic shopping experience for each of our millions of customers and awaits their timed onslaught. How do business strategies, re-architectures, new technologies, and a rabid customer base shape and re-shape the View? We will move across Eras: from Ruby on Rails and early Ajax techniques, to lightweight Java frameworks, to our current day; where asset management pipelines and JavaScript MVC frameworks are de rigueur. We&rsquo;ll discuss concerns like page performance, pagination, and search engine optimization through the lens of our Views present and past.</p>

<p>Last Thursday Lead Software Engineer Kristen McGregor (pictured above), a cardboard tri-fold, and I trekked to the <em>New York Times </em>building for the TimesOpen <a href="http://opensourcesciencefair.com/" target="_blank">Open Source Science Fair</a>: a showcase for local developers to demonstrate their open source projects, recruit potential contributors, and network with fellow FOSSniks. Now in its second/&ldquo;2.0&rdquo; year, the Fair took place on the <em>Times</em>&rsquo; 15th floor and featured exhibits by the likes of <a href="https://github.com/novus" target="_blank">Novus</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/nypl" target="_blank">New York Public Library</a>, <a href="https://github.com/meteor" target="_blank">Meteor</a>, and us!</p>
<p>Our booth focused on our use of the <a href="http://www.playframework.com/" target="_blank">Play Framework</a>&ndash;specifically, the <a href="http://live.gilt.com/" target="_blank">Gilt Live<span></span></a> page and our product pages. The technologists who stopped by to chat with us were genuinely interested in learning more about Play and the technologies we use, and several even signed up to receive information about our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/06/20/sign-up-for-free-scala-training-at-gilt" target="_blank">free training program</a>. When we weren&rsquo;t answering people&rsquo;s questions about concurrency or free Scala classes, we got to mingle with folk<em>s</em> from neighboring booths. Two of my favorite projects were <a href="https://github.com/jazzido/tabula" target="_blank">Tabula</a>, a data liberator that helps you conquer PDF bureaucracy with ease; and &ldquo;Best in Show&rdquo; award winner <a href="https://github.com/csvsoundsystem" target="_blank">CSV Soundsystem</a>, whose creators make electronic music based on U.S. economic data and other things:</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/j1PAuOXJ5uU" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>Gilt won the Dress Code Award, natch. We were also vying for the &ldquo;Swagmasters&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">Best Use of Ostriches</a>&rdquo; honors, but others bested us.</p>
<p>In addition to the featured projects, the Fair featured talks by talented Bitly scientist <a href="https://twitter.com/hmason" target="_blank">Hilary Mason</a>, Knight-Mozilla OpenNews Project Director Dan &ldquo;<a href="http://www.quaxelrod.com/" target="_blank">@MayorEmanuel</a>&rdquo; <a href="http://dansinker.com/" target="_blank">Sinker,</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/scarlettsparks" target="_blank">Haleigh Sheehan</a> of GitHub. The crowd was an eclectic and impressive bunch: I met data scientists from Buzzfeed, the <em>Times</em> and Pro Publica; researchers from Columbia University; the editor of the <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/" target="_blank">Freakonomics blog</a>; and an intern who solved one of her company&rsquo;s &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; archiving problems in just over three weeks. There were also fantastic views of the Hudson, googly eyes and glue sticks, and at least one creatively arranged strand of flickering holiday lights.</p>
<p>All in all, the Open Source Science Fair was an enlightening and inspiring way to spend a few hours hanging out with NYC technologists and getting to know some of the <a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">developers and data engineers</a> behind our nation&rsquo;s newspaper of record. Can&rsquo;t wait to see what next year&rsquo;s Fair looks like&ndash;this is one science experiment that works. Congrats to TimesOpen for putting together such a great event!</p>
