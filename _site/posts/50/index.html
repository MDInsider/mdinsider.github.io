<p>Making the social media rounds today is Typesafe&rsquo;s <a href="http://typesafe.com/blog/play_framework_akka_and_scala_at_gilt" target="_blank">in-depth Q&amp;A</a> with members of the Gilt Tech team. Learn about the backend technologies we use, our motivations for migrating to the Typesafe platform, the potential role of Scala, Akka and Play in the evolution of ecommerce, and much more. A highlight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><strong>Typesafe:</strong> </strong>How is the future of ecommerce evolving, and what role does Play, Akka and Scala have in addressing these shifts?</p>
<p><strong>Gilt:</strong> The ecommerce business is extremely competitive on price, speed, and features. From a development point of view, maintaining velocity is important for keeping features flowing with minimum friction. Being able to reliably build the tooling we need to simplify our internal workflows is also important for the back office. Flash sales typically have incredible non-functional requirements. Our sale spikes tend to involve a two-orders-of-magnitude increase in traffic over the course of a few seconds – so much so, that we often refer to “requests per decisecond” instead of “requests per second” to drive home how quickly traffic can ramp up. The Typesafe Platform has scaled really well for us across our internal verticals, making it simple for us to build, for example, internal-facing workflows using the same tooling we use to build the highest-performance web pages.</p>
<p>By being early adopters of Play, we were able to move quickly and easily to a WebSocket architecture (via actor integration) that has led to a nice increase in conversion. We’re still evaluating Akka, but as we gain more experience with it, we see it becoming an integral tool. Akka enables asynchronous front-ends and offers a faster, more responsive, progressive web experience than what we would have been able to achieve with similar effort on other platforms<strong>. </strong>The actor model helps to break down functional units in code and maintain focus on the workflow. It also reduces friction for concurrent programming by eliminating boilerplate code and the bugs that frequently come with it.</p>
<p>The Typesafe Platform enables us to move faster, build on what we have done, do less overall refactoring, and – we strongly believe – attract the best people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to Typesafe for asking us such great questions!</p>

<p>When my sister got married, I wanted to make sure that she had plenty of great photos of her wedding&ndash;so I set up a photo booth that captured images and instantly uploaded them to the Internet. Recently I described my setup at 5@4 (née <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/post/3291537111/the-friday-5-5" target="_blank">5@5</a>&ndash;Gilt Tech&rsquo;s ongoing presentation series, featuring five talks at 4 PM every other Friday) and invited Gilt Tech&rsquo;s photogenic crew, plus our resident dinosaurs, to try it out.</p>

<p>Interested in creating your own photo booth? Here&rsquo;s <strong>what you&rsquo;ll need:</strong></p>
<ul><li>A camera</li>
<li>A computer</li>
<li><a href="http://www.eye.fi/" target="_blank">Eye-Fi</a>, a wireless photo uploading <a href="http://www.eye.fi/buy-now" target="_blank">card</a>, inserted into your camera</li>
<li><a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php" target="_blank">Hazel</a>, to automatically organize the files. <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php" target="_blank">Download</a> and install it (watch <a href="http://www.macosxscreencasts.com/tutorial/hazel-tutorial/" target="_blank">this video</a> for extra help)</li>
<li>Photoshop</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> account</li>
<li><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2488" target="_blank">Automator</a></li>
</ul><div><strong>Then follow these steps:</strong><br/><ol><li>Take your picture. Eye-Fi will automatically send the photo from your camera to your computer.</li>
<li>Use Hazel&rsquo;s rule setup to watch the Eye-Fi folder and run the next step: adding a logo to your photos.</li>
<li>Run your photos through a <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/photoshop/cs/using/WSfd1234e1c4b69f30ea53e41001031ab64-7427a.html" target="_blank">Photoshop droplet</a> to automatically add the logo to each photo.</li>
<li>Use another Hazel rule to run the Automator workflow, which will send each picture via email to Flickr.</li>
<li>Visit your Flickr account and admire your work.</li>
</ol></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>Run that by me again, please?</strong></div>

    <p><img alt="image" height="198px;" id="docs-internal-guid-1aa21ddd-e340-4d53-5d6d-f2922606ab54" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wP5kUBeXSm-gO8zK7TVkAd1ovhTgf1QhMPVYJKst6B4TIfrQsm0gg9gdUZqeGmzSPeMNc7HP5HYdF-1e6rDKBit6lBHE20v7SMOXYmILwu9JccX9TBoGBBUl" width="540px;"/></p>
<p><span>In late June a few of us in NYC joined our colleagues in Gilt&rsquo;s Dublin office to test out </span><a href="http://basho.com/riak/" target="_blank">Riak</a> for our main user store. Every day our main user store receives upwards of 100,000 requests per minute at our peak site traffic time of 12PM. Because of these extreme traffic spikes, excellent performance of our distributed databases is a must.</p>
<p><span>We also wanted to learn more about how Riak supported multiple data centers (including EC2) in an active-active-active configuration: a mechanism that guarantees continuous service in the event a database goes down. Active-active-active configurations also allow requests to be serviced in any datacenter without requiring the request to leave the data center to retrieve user information. These capabilities are quite important to Gilt, because network connections between datacenters are never as fast as those located within a single datacenter.</span></p>
<p>On the hardware side, our plan was to install two rings, each consisting of five servers, in different datacenters, and then completely run Riak through the gauntlet. We had only one week to create this system. Luckily, we had the best help imaginable: <a href="https://twitter.com/cheeseplus" target="_blank">Seth Thomas</a> and <a href="http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/" target="_blank">Steve Vinoski</a> from Basho, the company that created Riak.</p>
<p>Riak passed all of our tests with high marks, and also performed well during various failure scenarios we staged.</p>
<p>In terms of the actual testing, our goal was to duplicate our user service and point it at a Riak datastore instead of our current datastore. This, of course, required altering the service code. I&rsquo;m not a big fan of the <a href="http://www.cakesolutions.net/teamblogs/2011/12/19/cake-pattern-in-depth/" target="_blank">cake pattern</a>, which in my experience results in obfuscated code, but I have to admit that&ndash;at least in this case&ndash;it simplified the code rework and made the code cleaner.</p>
<p>After using Riak to duplicate our user service, our next step was to write some code to copy our existing users&rsquo; information to the new Riak backend. The speed of our current infrastructure enabled us to copy our entire user set to Riak during non-peak hours.</p>
<p>Once we had everything humming in our cluster of user services and Riak instance, we began simulating reads and writes to the service as they occurred in production. To do this, we used <a href="https://github.com/ebowman/splitter/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">splitter</a>: an open source project, created by Gilt VP Architecture Eric Bowman, that accepts requests and forwards them to two different backends. One of the responses is kept, and the other is discarded. In this case we discarded the Riak response. We then configured our load balance (Zeus) to forward requests to the splitter instead of directly to the service. This put read traffic on our test user service.</p>
<p>To simulate write traffic, we wrote a small bit of code to publish <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank">RabbitMQ</a> messages any time a write or update occurred; consumed those messages on the test user service; and duplicated the write or update. Read-and-writes were now being executed against the test service cluster without putting our production system in any real danger. Testing looked good so far.</p>
<p>To really make sure Riak was as solid as it seemed, we then decided to ramp up the read/write load. We simulated an extreme read load by using <a href="http://blogs.riverbed.com/stingray/2009/03/introducing-zeusbench.html" target="_blank">Zeusbench</a>, which executed an extreme number of HTTP requests against our test service and provided metrics on how the service performed (you can find a number of open source alternatives to Zeusbench).  We also wrote a quick program that executed upwards of 1,500 insertions into Riak per second.  We kept the inserts going the entire time.  Read/write performance didn’t suffer, even under this amount of load.</p>
<p>Our final test involved kill -9’ing Riak nodes and monitoring how the cluster performed.  While removing Riak nodes, we maintained production load against the service. Riak performed well during these situations.</p>
<p>Riak&rsquo;s strong performance suggests that, should we pursue implementation, it will withstand our unique traffic needs and prove reliable. As for the Gilt-Basho team’s strong performance: It was amazing that we were able to accomplish so much in just a week’s time! Thanks again to Seth and Steve for making this possible.</p>

    <p><strong><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/d726f3f54205357b84d704fd73f8cf34/tumblr_inline_mpty7azj2S1qz4rgp.jpg"/></strong></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-48c00d6e-d386-817a-840c-bca597881391"><strong>What is your role at Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;m lead engineer for Team Galactus. (We like to give our teams abstract names that don’t refer to a particular initiative; at the time of forming Galactus, we were going through a comic book phase!) I&rsquo;m a full-stack engineer, but the vast majority of my work at Gilt is on the backend: developing shared libraries, web applications and services.</span></p>
<p><strong>How long have you been with Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>Just over two years.</span></p>
<p><strong>Has your role here changed over time?</strong></p>
<p><span>No, I&rsquo;ve always been a backend engineer. I&rsquo;ve done some frontend stuff with previous companies that were very small, and where you had to roll up your sleeves and basically do everything.</span></p>
<p><strong>Why do you enjoy backend development more than frontend?</strong></p>
<p><span>It&rsquo;s less like the Wild West than frontend development. You can implement clean, well-tested and reusable solutions fairly easily; it’s a lot more difficult to do that in the frontend. Frontend work often feels like one hack on top of another hack, with a third hack thrown in to work around some IE issue. And it all feels really fragile, because it&rsquo;s not statically typed. Refactoring something can be a very stressful experience! There have been a few frameworks over the years built to try to solve this problem (e.g. GWT), but it&rsquo;s still generally a more challenging environment to work in. Throw CSS into the mix, which can do some really cool, untestable stuff, and … well, you get the picture.</span></p>
<p><strong>Which technologies do you use on a day-to-day basis?</strong></p>
<p><span>Scala, Play, Handlebars (both the standard JS Handlebars and Gilt&rsquo;s own Scala implementation&ndash;fondly called </span><span><a href="https://github.com/mwunsch/handlebars.scala" target="_blank">Scandlebars</a>, and written by Gilt engineer Mark Wunsch. </span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>What’s your personal strategy for learning a new technology?</strong></p>
<p><span>My inclination is always to just learn on the job. That only gets you so far, though. And when you’re working on important pieces of software, you need to be the expert in the technologies you are using. Taking time out to really learn those technologies is something I have to work hard at; it’s not something that comes naturally. My preference when I do need to learn something in detail is a good old-fashioned paper book&ndash;remember those?</span></p>
<p><span>I recently took Martin Odersky&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun" target="_blank">Coursera course on </a></span><span><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun" target="_blank">Scala</a>. This was really enjoyable.</span></p>
<p><strong>Describe for us some of the projects that you’ve been working on recently.</strong></p>
<p><span>The team is currently in the process of migrating our sale listing page (the most visited page on Gilt: ~30k rpm at noon) over to a new technology stack: Play, Scala, Handlebars, and Solr. As part of that work we are building a new app and adding a lot of new code to shared libraries.</span></p>
<p><span>We are also working to integrate Scalatest/Selenium testing into our continuous delivery framework. Continuous delivery allows us to deploy to production in minutes at any time with no manual interaction after the developer types “sbt release” on their laptop. Having really good Selenium test coverage, written using Scalatest, is a key part of that.</span></p>
<p><span>A small side project I’ve just completed is a piece of code that allows you to build “views” of a cache. You simply provide a transformation function, and you get back a virtual cache of a different type. The views themselves can be cached (if the transformation is expensive) and you can stack them, so you can have views of views. Getting the type system to work was a bit of a mind melt, but I think the end result is pretty cool. </span></p>
<p><strong>One technology you’ve been using lately is Solr. Tell us more about that.</strong></p>
<p><span>We started using Solr to power some basic search capabilities on the site in 2011. Galactus then built keyword search using the same technology stack. We are now moving the sale listing page onto Solr&ndash;after all, a sale listing is simply a search for all products with a particular sale ID. This means that less code is required to power the site. As part of moving the listing page over, we’re really having to step up the performance of the search technology stack. It has to be scalable and really fast!</span></p>
<p><strong>What’s been your biggest accomplishment here?</strong></p>
<p><span>I’ve done a few things that I’m proud of. Early on, I think my biggest accomplishment was &ldquo;getting&rdquo; the Gilt technology stack so quickly, and being able to contribute within a few weeks of joining. I’ve since worked on some pretty core pieces of software like Commons, which is a client library for Gilt’s domain model; the sale targeting engine, which targets sales to the appropriate members; and keyword search. I also recently led the redevelopment of the product page: a complete rewrite of the old page from the bottom up.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What would you say are the best parts about working at Gilt? And more specifically, about working at Gilt-Dublin?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The pace&ndash;things move very fast all the time. We&rsquo;re on the cutting edge in terms of continuous delivery, the technologies we’re using, and some of the testing tools we&rsquo;re building.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, the people. Gilt has some great people in so many different areas. I&rsquo;ve learnt more in my first two years at Gilt than I did in the previous eight years since I left college. The Dublin office, being a bit younger than Gilt NYC, feels a little more like a start-up in some ways. There&rsquo;s a really good atmosphere. Despite being the new kid on the block, we&rsquo;re solving big problems and we&rsquo;re doing great work!</span></p>
<p><span>The actual office itself is also fantastic: A penthouse office in the city centre with great views. Plus it&rsquo;s in Dublin, the best city in the world!</span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about mentoring and your on-the-job inspiration sources?</strong></p>
<p><span>While Gilt is using some really cool and interesting technologies, I&rsquo;m an engineer rather than a technologist, so solving problems is what makes me want to go to work each day&ndash;and Gilt has some really hard, interesting problems to solve.</span></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;m also lucky to work with exceptional people. This is also a great inspiration: working with people who, in pretty much every interaction I have with them, teach me something.</span></p>

<p>On Wednesday, around 70 Play framework enthusiasts visited Gilt&rsquo;s 2 Park Ave. office in NYC for the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Play-NYC/" target="_blank">Play NYC</a> meetup group&rsquo;s &ldquo;Async Coding in Play and Scala&rdquo; talk, featuring LinkedIn engineer Jim Brikman. To add to our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/07/10/async-coding-in-play-with-both-java-and-scala" target="_blank">earlier post</a> about the meetup: Jim&rsquo;s discussion of Play&rsquo;s non-blocking IO nature.</p>

<ul><li>Seeing identical Play-powered functionality implemented in both Java and Scala highlighted how much more efficient and concise Scala is.</li>
<li>Play and Scala are a great match, especially when it comes to async coding, mostly due to functions being first-class citizens, and having access to great syntax &ldquo;candy&rdquo; such as sequence comprehensions.</li>
<li>If you are stuck in Javaland but want to write more async code and not drown in boilerplate, check out <a href="https://github.com/linkedin/parseq" target="_blank">ParSeq</a>.</li>

  <h1><a href="/2013/07/11/making-cents-of-census-data">Making Cents of Census Data</a></h1>
  
  <header>
    
    <time>11 July 2013</time>

  <div class="content">
    <p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/59dfe75b26101b1a5810b9ba9ece30e1/tumblr_inline_mpsptfpVPS1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>

<p>If you work in data science, you’ve probably come across websites that present U.S. Census data with fancy bells and whistles (such as associated maps) that you can use to find demographic information. These websites, which usually charge a fee, often allow you to look up limited amounts of data&ndash;and typically one zip code at a time.</p>
<p>As proponents of open source, we’ve decided to skip the fees and share, for free, <a href="https://www.google.com/fusiontables/data?docid=10OPke4LpmpphYB8jXHM3mysdEcbtxrbKn3AIXw0#rows:id=1" target="_blank">this easy-to-use file</a> that aggregates 2010 U.S. Census data and 2007-2011 American Community Survey data, aggregated to the zip code level.</p>
<p>Parsing and aggregating the data into something digestible was an excruciating process, but I’m glad I did it. At Gilt we aggregate data at the ZIP code level to better understand the demographic profile of our customers. The above table helps us gain insights into the general demographic profile of the areas of high and low customer membership/activity. For example, we can compare membership and order conversion in rural vs. urban areas, or differentiate purchasing and web behavior in high vs. low income areas. I say “general” because the data is aggregated to the postal code level, it&rsquo;s not about a specific individual.</p>
<h3>I was warned</h3>
<p>As a database administrator and data engineer, I occasionally receive interesting data-related requests from my colleagues. One of the more interesting inquiries I’ve fielded recently came from one of Team Data’s very own&ndash;Data Scientist Igor Elbert. Igor’s known to pepper his own data analyses with references to Russian literature and World War II history, so I wasn’t totally surprised that his request was a bit on the exciting and creative side (as far as data requests go).</p>
<p>I was warned that Igor’s request might be a bit tedious to fulfill. Yet it seemed simple enough (just three steps!):</p>
<ul><li>parse the census data</li>
<li>import it into Gilt&rsquo;s data warehouse and</li>
<li>aggregate the data by zip code in order to better visualize the demographic information about our customer base.</li>
</ul><p>I did not heed the warning, and enthusiastically dove into the world of U.S. government data. This process turned out to be far more complex and interesting than I initially thought it would be, and also involved importing the subset of American Community Survey (ACS) data about people’s economic status, education level, and house value. The census data was only available in an archaic&ndash;i.e., end-of-the-20th-century&ndash;format. Column names corresponded to lookup values. Tables were embedded tables within tables, differentiated with a &ldquo;table&rdquo; column. To find what I was looking for required an additional lookup of the attribute associated with each value.</p>
<h3>Processing the Data</h3>
<p>In order to find out what kinds of data the columns represented, I had two options:</p>
<ol><li>Extract the data from a giant PDF “tech-doc” file that comes with the Census and ACS</li>
<li>Use the provided Microsoft Access data shells (of course I do not, nor will I ever, have a copy of Microsoft Access). An alternative to using Access is <a href="http://mdbtools.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">mdb-tools</a>.</li>
</ol><p>I chose option #2, since this could be automated. It’s both humorous and sad that the U.S. Census Bureau still presents its data using MS Access and MS Excel instead of an open source database or some other format. New York City and other governmental bodies around the world <a href="denied:%E2%80%9Dhttp://blog.gopivotal.com/p-o-v/building-hackable-cities-through-open-data-portals%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">make their data available in more modern and open formats</a>, yet the federal government apparently can’t let go of its pre-Y2K technologies. Access still enforces a 255-column limit-per-table restriction on files, which for my purposes resulted in about 290 segmented files per state. I used mostly Perl and some Scala to automate parsing of these files into Aster Database/PostgreSQL-compatible SQL and data files.</p>
<p>Here’s where things got interesting: After parsing all of that poorly presented census data, I discovered that it contained a wealth of information that can be correlated to find out more about Gilt’s customer base&ndash;and how we can better target our marketing to reach them. The census data includes a geographic information lookup table that provides information on state, county, Combined Statistical Area (CBSA) and aggregation or summary level (the geographic level the data represents&ndash;for example, state, county, county/sub-county, or zip code):</p>

    <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Play-NYC/events/125123622/">Async Coding in Play with both Java and Scala</a><br/><p>Tonight (Wed 7/10) Gilt once again plays host to the Play NYC meetup. On this evening’s agenda: LinkedIn’s <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jbrikman" target="_blank">Jim Brikman</a> presents &ldquo;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Play-NYC/events/125123622/" target="_blank">Async Coding in Play with both Java and Scala</a>,&rdquo; a discussion of the non-blocking IO (NIO) nature of the Play framework:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this talk, I’ll discuss how Play offers an escape from thread pool hell, how it opens the door to real-time web applications (e.g WebSockets), and how to write asynchronous code in Java and Scala without getting stuck in callback hell.</p>

<p>Every now and then, some of us at Gilt Tech like to break out our department&rsquo;s favorite antique floral tablecloth and silver tea set, round up a few decadent pastries, and hold a high tea. Or so I learned yesterday, when Senior Director, Program Management Office Heather Fleming (glamorously outfitted for the occasion in a fuchsia dress) stopped by my desk to invite me. Being a connoisseur of caffeine and sugar, I could not say no.</p>
<p>At Gilt, all of our conference and meeting rooms are named after cities or countries. Yesterday&rsquo;s tea took place in conference room Cuba (a country where tea is <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.ca/Travel-g147270-c62985/Cuba:Caribbean:Things.To.Know.Before.You.Go.html" target="_blank">maybe not the most popular drink</a>, but our &ldquo;England&rdquo; room only accommodates two people&ndash;far too small for such a festive gathering). Arranged on the conference table were plates and platters stacked with rich chocolate cakes, croissants, green (purposely so) pound cake, and teas of all types. In the background, jazzy music played.</p>
<p>I took a seat next to Justin Riservato, senior program manager and ambivalent keeper of the official Gilt tea set. Majestic and slightly tarnished (&ldquo;patina'ed&rdquo;), the tea set once belonged to Gilt Tech&rsquo;s &hellip; fictitious great-great-great-great-grandparents, W. Chester Chichestershire Gilt IV and Hester Chichestershire (née Middleton) Gilt. Some say that one day, while in a typically generous mood, one of the Chichestershire Gilt the IVs&rsquo; &hellip; also fictitious children quietly left the set at our 2 Park Ave. office for posterity. &ldquo;Now the tea set stays here and appears in 50 percent of our Gilt Tech office photos,&rdquo; Justin explained. It also serves us well at high teas, of course.</p>
<p>Like many things at Gilt Tech, high teas are the result of people <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/03/07/scaling-agile-at-gilt-with-teams-ingredients" target="_blank">taking initiative</a> and demonstrating strong stewardship, creativity, and ingenuity. Providing the best customer experience possible is also key. At least 15 people stopped in for a cup of hot Devonshire or bite of croissant. Many lingered. By the end, all of the cakes were (mostly) gone.</p>
<p>Sound fun? Maybe you and your colleagues should hold your own high tea. Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll need to reproduce ours:</p>
<p><strong>High Tea Checklist</strong></p>
<ul><li>Imaginary 19th century relatives</li>
<li>Floral heirloom tablecloth with matching napkins</li>
<li>A person wearing a top hat (pocket watch is also acceptable)</li>
<li>Music: French jazz, Handel, Tchaikovsky, some of the Wu-Tang Clan&rsquo;s quieter numbers, no 1980s metal</li>
<li>Photogenic antique tea set that&rsquo;s too heavy to transport home</li>
<li>A rich chocolate cake with a surprise plastic knife baked into it (?)</li>
<li>Pound cake</li>
<li>Croissants and turnovers (cronuts are probably not acceptable)</li>
<li>cups (preferably Gilt mugs)</li>
<li>hot water</li>
<li>a curated selection of teas (Earl Grey, English Breakfast, green for the health-conscious)</li>
<li>milks: cow, soy, etc.</li>
<li>sugars: turbinado, honey, refined, brown, powdered (don&rsquo;t overdo it, though)</li>
<li>place settings</li>
<li>a roomful of awesome people to share the experience with</li>
</ul><p>Feel free to send photos of your high tea experiences to lapple at gilt dot com. Cheerio!</p>
