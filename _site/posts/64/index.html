<p><span></span><span><span>Achieving this is easier said than done.

  <h1><a href="/2011/02/10/asynchronous-specs">Asynchronous Specs</a></h1>
  
  <header>
    
    <time>10 February 2011</time>
    
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>While working on <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2011/02/09/test-swarm" target="_blank">TestSwarm</a>, we ran into the problem that none of the JavaScript testing frameworks out there had really solved the problem of how to test asynchronous behavior without requiring the test writer to do something different from how (s)he would test non-asynchronous behavior.</p>

<p>e.g. Testing these two lines should be done the same way:</p>

<pre><code>callThisImmediately(function () {});
callThisIn5Seconds(function() {});
</code></pre>

<p>Every other testing framework we looked at required using something like wait() and resume(), or mock timers, or completely ignored the problem.</p>

<p>So…I decided to write my own testing framework, with testing asynchronous behaviors (like AJAX requests, animations, countdowns, timeouts, etc.) in mind from the very beginning. Since we also have a lot of Rubyists here, we wanted the syntax to be as close to RSpec as possible.</p>

<p>Thus was born <strong>ASpec</strong>:</p>

<p><img alt="ASpec" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgf7vgo9fD1qzxg4t.png"/></p>

<p>For the most part this was fairly straightforward, but there were two itty bitty little problems. The first was of course… how does ASpec know that there is asynchronous behavior? And two, what should it do about it?</p>

<p>We solved the first one using a little regex and <code>Function.prototype.toString()</code>. Simply put, ASpec counts the number of <code>expects</code> in an <code>it</code> block before it executes that it block. when an <code>expect</code> gets executed, we count that too. When we exit the <code>it</code> block, if the two numbers aren’t the same, well, chances are that there was asynchronous behavior. Either that or unreachable code, conditional statements, or a good old runtime error.</p>

<p>As for the 2nd problem, we solved that too. If we have any pending <code>expects</code>, everything after that gets put into a queue, and is executed after the pending <code>expect</code> is done. Or times out.</p>

<p>When everything is done, we wind up with a nice little report that TestSwarm can take a screenshot of:</p>

<p><img alt="ASpec Test Runner" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgf7wmXlRZ1qzxg4t.png"/></p>

<p>Well, that’s okay (sorry about the purple), but if I’m testing something, I’d rather not have to leave the command line in order to do so. Not to mention, I’d like to have a way to test all my specs at once. And of course, I’d like to be able to test everything before I commit.</p>

<p>Therefore, we created a little rake task: <code>rake spec</code>. If you’re a Rubyist, it probably sounds familiar.</p>

<p>Our version of <code>rake spec</code> even produces output similar to the <a href="http://rspec.info/" target="_blank">RSpec</a> version:</p>

<p><img alt="ASpec rake tasks" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgf7x6ikaS1qzxg4t.png"/></p>

<p>If you peek under the hood, what you’ll see is a couple simple-minded tcp servers, and the Mac OSX <code>open</code> command (with the <code>--background</code> flag).</p>

<p>And of course, since we want to be able to test in different browsers, we can run <code>rake spec:firefox</code>, <code>rake spec:chrome</code> and <code>rake spec:safari</code>. Sorry, IE.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2011/02/10/the-xcode-organizer-doesnt-show-me-all-my-crash">The Xcode Organizer Doesn't Show Me All My Crash Logs. Help!</a></h1>
  
  <header>
    
    <time>10 February 2011</time>
    
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>When you’re developing an iPhone or iPad application, running the app on the device is essential to understanding whether your code is working correctly. Although the iOS Simulator is very useful for testing functionality and user interface interactions, it doesn’t provide a very good simulation of the memory constraints your app will face on actual devices. As a result, applications that run fine in the simulator may be unexpectedly terminated by the operating system when run on devices.</p>
<p>Often, but not always, crashes that happen only on the device are due to memory warnings that are not being handled correctly by your application. Unfortunately, if your application terminates unexpectedly on the device, you’re not always given a clear indication of the cause.</p>
<p>One tool for diagnosing such problems is the Xcode Organizer. The left-hand sidebar of the Organizer window contains a list of the various devices that have been hooked up to your computer over time. While a development-enabled device is connected to your computer, the Organizer window will show a green dot next to the device name, and the if you select a connected device in the “Devices” list, you will see a number of tabs at the top of the main part of the window.</p>
<p>The “Device Logs” tab <em>should</em> show any crash logs recoded on the device for the applications you’re developing. On my installation of Xcode, however, crash logs don’t always appear there, making it difficult to determine with any surety the cause of a given crash. (I’m not sure why certain logs are omitted from the Organizer; I just know that in my experience, they don’t always show up. I’m currently running Xcode 3.2.6.)</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a work-around. If you sync a device through iTunes, it turns out that new crash logs are copied from the device to a location within your home directory. You can find the crash logs for your device(s) within:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><code>~/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/MobileDevice</code></div>
</blockquote>
<p>Inside that directory, you’ll see a directory for each device that (1) has been synced through iTunes, and (2) had crash logs to copy at the time it was synced. (The name of the directory will be taken from the name of the device.)</p>
<p>If a given application crashed due to an exception such as EXC_BAD_ACCESS, you should see a log file containing the name of the application’s executable followed by a timestamp indicating the time of the crash. The contents of the log file will give you more information about the nature of the problem.</p>
<p>When the operating system terminates applications due to low memory conditions, it will create a log file starting with the name “LowMemory-” followed by a timestamp. The file will list any application(s) terminated and give clues about the memory usage of each.</p>
<p>Even when running an application on the device within the debugger, console output isn’t always clear about the reason that an app was terminated. In those cases, the Xcode Organizer seems like the right place to look, but you might not find all the expected logs there. Syncing your device with iTunes and digging into the log files copied to your local filesystem is sometimes the only way to get the clues you need to diagnose certain types of unexpected terminations.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2011/02/09/test-swarm">Continuous Integration for JavaScript with TestSwarm</a></h1>
  
  <header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>We like the principles of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">Test Driven Development</a> (or some variation thereof). But we also have an increasingly large JavaScript library, and JavaScript testing is hard.</p>

<p>There are tools like <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/" target="_blank">Selenium</a> that offer a full testing suite and there are tools like <a href="https://github.com/brynary/webrat" target="_blank">Webrat</a> that simulate a browser for application acceptance testing, but those tools still don&rsquo;t solve the &ldquo;JavaScript testing is hard&rdquo; problem. That problem is <em>browsers</em>.</p>

<p>John Resig and team <a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-testing-does-not-scale/" target="_blank">ran into this problem</a> while developing jQuery:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The end result is that we need to run 10 separate test suites in 12 separate browsers before and after every single commit to jQuery core. <strong>Cross-Browser JavaScript testing does not scale.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That blog post really defined the problem. We Front End Engineers needed some Continuous Integration love: An automated way of testing our JS libraries across multiple browser environments.</p>

<p>Resig also came up with a solution to the problem, and we&rsquo;ve recently rolled it out here at Gilt: <a href="https://github.com/jeresig/testswarm/wiki" target="_blank">TestSwarm</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TestSwarm provides distributed continuous integration testing for JavaScript.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Users (on various browsers) connect to the server and run the test runner. The runner will wait for new suites to come in from a git hook.

<p>The results are recorded for each commit and hopefully everything is green.
<img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lgd6ms3Kn21qzxg4t.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>And now we have to begin the hardest part of this task: beginning a TDD practice and making sure our JavaScript has full test coverage.</p>

    <p>We’ve made a number of optimizations to our iPhone/iPad codebase over the past couple of months, the effects of which can be seen in the attached video:</p>

<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="267" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/19722439?portrait=0" width="475"></iframe></p>

<p><em>(Because our application is so dependent on the network, the new code won’t appear to outperform the old code 100% of the time. This is due to the vagaries of the connection between the devices and the server.)</em></p>

<p>As we prepare to submit this latest code to Apple, we decided to make some of our optimization techniques public in the hopes that it may benefit developers outside of our company:</p>

<ul><li>In a number of places in our code, we were spawning new threads to perform short-lived operations. We’ve rewritten a number of these as <code>NSOperations</code>, allowing us to use <code>NSOperationQueue</code> instances, which are implemented under the hood by the OS as thread pools. So we’re spawning fewer new threads and reusing existing threads more; as a result, we’ve avoided some overhead of launching new threads. Also, since the OS is able to manage threading behavior for us via the <code>NSOperationQueue</code>, the OS is able to make smart decisions at runtime about thread resource usage that we were previously hard-coding at development time. Our assumptions could never be correct for all cases, since each device may have a different number of other processes running at any time. The OS itself is in the best position to make such decisions.</li>
<li>Using the <code>@synchronized</code> construct for thread safety in iOS is <strong>very</strong> expensive. (Part of the reason for this is that <code>@synchronized</code> sets up inherent exception handlers.) So, one major optimization was to replace <code>@synchronized</code> blocks with using the <code>NSLock</code>/<code>NSRecursiveLock</code> classes for thread safety. Doing this reduced thread waits that occur during lock contention, improving app performance overall.</li>
<li>Another way we avoid unnecessary locking is by using the thread-local storage provided by the <code>threadDictionary:</code> method of <code>NSThread</code>. Thread-unsafe resources that are expensive to construct—but that don’t take up a lot of memory—are good candidates for this. So, instead of constructing many short-lived objects on an as-needed basis, we can construct one per thread and keep it in thread-local storage. This ensures that the resources are used in a thread-safe manner, while avoiding the expense of repeated instantiations. (This technique is less useful for short-lived threads that are spawned often, because in those cases you won’t be avoiding the instantiation costs. Note, too, that Apple recommends against using thread-local storage for threads managed by <code>NSOperationQueues</code>.)</li>
<li>We discovered that instantiating and using the <code>NSDateFormatter</code> class is particularly expensive. (And, because the <code>NSDateFormatter</code> class is not thread-safe, we can’t share instances across threads.) We use this class to parse text dates that arrive from the server. So, to avoid the instantiation expense, we’re caching <code>NSDateFormatter</code>s in thread-local storage. Also, in our particular case, because so many of the date strings we’re parsing turn out to be identical (a result of many sales starting at the same time), we’re avoiding some of the date parsing altogether by maintaining a cache with date string keys that point to the <code>NSDate</code> instances that resulted from parsing that date string. Most of our dates now don’t need to be parsed at all; we just need to look up the <code>NSDate</code> associated with a given date string. Doing this shaved 5%-10% off the processing done at app startup.</li>
<li>Our old caching system used a SQLite database; we’re now using the filesystem for caching, which avoids all the marshalling/unmarshalling required by the database accesses. This is particularly beneficial for our image cache. Now that cached images are stored in the filesystem, we can load them directly with <code>[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile:]</code>. Previously, our image data was first loaded into an <code>NSData</code> instance that was then passed to <code>[UIImage imageWithData:]</code>. Not only does this new technique perform better, but by using this method to reference images, the OS has the option of purging image data from memory and reconstituting it directly from the file on an as-needed basis. (Whether or not a given version of iOS does this is another story, but at least this technique gives the OS that option.) That’s not possible if we were still using <code>[UIImage imageWithData:]</code>; the OS can’t purge the image data in that case since there would be no way to transparently reconstitute it if the image data were needed again. This gives the OS the ability to better manage memory on our behalf.</li>
<li>Since a big factor in iOS app performance is the memory footprint of the application, we’re also making better decisions about what images to store in our memory cache. Large images in iOS are particularly expensive, since the operating system stores image data uncompressed in memory. The large Gilt sale images are over 6MB uncompressed, and we’re now avoiding caching those in memory altogether. (We now only cache images in memory if their uncompressed size is less than 1MB.) This reduces the amount of memory warnings our app has to handle, which means we don’t have to flush our memory caches as often. As a result, all of our various memory caches have more cache hits and fewer misses; our memory caches are now more efficient.</li>
</ul><p>If there’s any interest in my going into further detail on any of these items, let me know. In the meantime, I hope you find this helpful!</p>
