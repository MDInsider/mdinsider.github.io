  <div class="content">
    <p>Tomorrow (Wed 7/10) Gilt CTO and cofounder Michael Bryzek will present &ldquo;Truly Scale a Modern Tech Organization With Great Engineers&rdquo; as part of AppNexus&rsquo; &ldquo;Engineering @ Scale&rdquo; series. Bryzek&rsquo;s talk&ndash;which is free to the public&ndash;takes place at AppNexus&rsquo; office at 28 W. 23rd Street in Manhattan. Doors open at 6:30 PM, and the event lasts until 8:30 PM. <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/6966921249/?ref=garysguide" target="_blank">RSVP here</a> to claim your seat!</p>
<p>In his presentation, Bryzek will recount Gilt&rsquo;s growth into a global leader with more than 1,000 employees. Gilt&rsquo;s success is partly attributable to its embrace of <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/03/07/scaling-agile-at-gilt-with-teams-ingredients" target="_blank">decentralized decision-making and ownership</a> within the organization&ndash;a strategy that Bryzek described at Tech in Motion&rsquo;s recent &ldquo;<a href="http://tech.gilt.com/tagged/gilttech-michaelbryzek-techinmotion-nyc-nyu-rosenthalpavilion" target="_blank">Made in NY: Tech Panel</a>,&rdquo; and will discuss in greater detail tomorrow.

<p>Gilt&rsquo;s proud to be the lanyard sponsor of this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://lambdajam.com" target="_blank">Lambda Jam</a> conference for functional programmers, taking place now through July 10 in Chicago. Among this year&rsquo;s featured presenters is Gilt software engineer Kevin Scaldeferri, who earlier today gave a talk on &ldquo;<a href="http://lambdajam.com/sessions#scaldeferri" target="_blank">Enabling Microservice Architectures with Scala</a>.&rdquo; Kevin&rsquo;s presentation focused on the many interesting ways that we use Scala at Gilt&ndash;from using the cake pattern to bridge the divide between unit testing and functional testing, to creating an SBT uber-plugin to abstract and unify our development process.</p>
<p>In addition to talks, each day of Lambda Jam includes hours of hands-on workshops on <a href="http://lambdajam.com/sessions#raychaudhuri" target="_blank">Scala</a>, <a href="http://lambdajam.com/sessions#feldman" target="_blank">CoffeeScript</a>, <a href="http://lambdajam.com/sessions#vinoski" target="_blank">Riak</a>, and other technologies. Chicago in the summertime is a great place to be, so hopefully some of you are reading this from the Windy City!</p>

  <header>

  <div class="content">
    <p><iframe frameborder="0" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/IJCfXRO00wM" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://jquery.org/" target="_blank">The jQuery Foundation</a> just posted video of &ldquo;If You Love It So Much, Why Don&rsquo;t You Write a Wrapper Around It?&rdquo;&ndash;my presentation at last month&rsquo;s jQuery Conference in Portland, Ore. In my talk, I focus on the importance of using consistent APIs and taking advantage of other people&rsquo;s work (in the form of third-party code) when working with a large code base. Putting a wrapper around someone else&rsquo;s code can give you the API and feature set you want, while saving you tons of tedious work writing business logic.</p>
<p>The last time I attended jQCon was in 2010, when it was held in Boston. The conference is sponsored by jQuery, and certainly features a fair amount of jQuery-related content, but one of the things I appreciate most about it is its focus on larger-scale, front-end issues of the day. This year was no exception.</p>
<p>Back in 2010, two major themes that emerged during jQCon were pubsub messaging and client-side templating. At that time, Gilt was somewhat behind the curve in these areas. Our front-end team came back from the conference feeling inspired and energized, and built systems to handle both pubsub messaging and client-side templating. One was Gilt.Notify, an adaptation of Peter Higgins&rsquo; <a href="https://github.com/phiggins42/bloody-jquery-plugins/blob/master/pubsub.js" target="_blank">pubsub plugin</a>. The other system was Gilt.Template, which at the time was a template-engine-agnostic wrapper around client-side templating (since different teams were using different template engines). Both of these systems have evolved over time, as we&rsquo;ve normalized to one template engine (<a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank">Handlebars</a>) and added private pubsub channels that function like observers, but both are still part of our new module-based front-end stack.</p>
<p>In 2013, we find ourselves right in line with the current state of the industry. Featured talks covered HTML5 polyfills, CSS3 animations, front-end unit testing, client-side MVC, promises, A/B testing, client-side build tools, and—as the topic of my presentation illustrates—wrapping third-party plugins and libraries. Gilt has been working on all the above over the past couple years, and it was good to know that we&rsquo;re up-to-date with the latest in front-end technology.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.arkitrave.com/speaking/jquery-2013" target="_blank">Check out the slides here</a>. If your window is large enough, you&rsquo;ll see at the bottom the notes I wrote to accompany the slides.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p><span><em><img alt="image" height="597" src="http://media.tumblr.com/1908982e0f32fe6675eb06753fd047e4/tumblr_inline_mpdhulzgdb1qz4rgp.jpg" width="800"/></em></span></p>

<p><span><em>On July 1 and 2, Gilt hosted two days of <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/06/20/sign-up-for-free-scala-training-at-gilt" target="_blank">free Scala classes</a> for our engineers and invited outside developers from the NYC programming community to join us. Gilt City Software Engineer Jennifer Shin participated in the first training day. Here&rsquo;s her recap:</em><br/></span></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid--b23e67e-a5be-f15e-e15b-d26614249b0a"><span>On Monday I attended “Programming Scala,” the kickoff course of Gilt’s new, free training program. Being new to <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank">Scala</a>, functional programming, and Gilt itself (I started working here in June), I really didn’t know what to expect. My assumption was that the class would cover only basic Scala concepts: how to define a method, how to extend traits, the difference between functional and object-oriented programming&ndash;you know, simple stuff.</span></p>
<p><span>Boy, was I wrong.</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, our instructor, <a href="http://agiledeveloper.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Venkat Subramaniam</a>, was amazing. Despite having to explain complicated programming concepts to 18 inquisitive programmers&ndash;and remain on his feet&ndash;for nine full hours, Dr. Subramaniam somehow never lost his enthusiasm, patience, energy, or sense of humor. He not only explained the </span><span>what </span><span>and </span><span>how </span><span>of each concept and technique, he also&ndash;and most importantly&ndash;gave us the </span><span>why</span><span>. Knowing the </span><span>why </span><span>is extremely helpful when you hang out almost exclusively in the OOP world, and are wondering, “</span><span>why do I even </span><span>want </span><span>to learn functional programming?” </span><span>If you ever want to listen to </span><span>anyone</span><span> talk about Scala for about nine hours straight, you can’t do much better than Dr. Subramaniam. (And for free? Are you kidding me? Sign me up any day.)</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to learning about collections, combinators, classes and other Scala topics, I also spent the day coming to the realization that trying to grasp the main concepts of an entire programming language in a single day is a major challenge. At one point during the afternoon, my lab exercise teammate gave me a look that said, “I&hellip;can’t&hellip;fit&hellip;any more&hellip;knowledge&hellip;in&hellip;my&hellip;brain.” I understood exactly. Towards the end of the day, after completing numerous exercises and trying to grasp approximately 100 different concepts, I felt like my head would explode from either information saturation or exhaustion. But, I must say, I was grateful for this feeling. </span></p>
<p><span>I left Dr. Subramaniam’s class with two new, essential tools: Scala programming experience, and a handy training manual (bedtime reading!) filled with additional explanations and examples. The labs helped to break up the lecture-filled day, and enabled us to put the topics into practice. Dr. Subramaniam provided programmatic examples for nearly every concept explained, which we cloned via SVN. “What’s so great about functional programming?” “How and why are companion objects really used?” Our class got to contemplate and explore such questions&hellip;And more!</span></p>
<p><span>I am incredibly impressed that Gilt provided such awesome training&ndash;not only for our engineers, but for non-Gilt developers with an interest in learning Scala. In addition to more than two dozen Gilt engineers, the two Scala sessions included eight developers from the NYC metro programming community. The experience was ridiculously educational, only slightly painful, and downright enjoyable.</span></p>

<p>Gilt CEO Michelle Peluso recently met with a group of the company&rsquo;s women technologists to share some of her personal stories about being a business leader, wife, and mother, and to offer advice relevant to all professionals&ndash;regardless of gender. Over lunch, Peluso answered our questions about a wide range of topics&ndash;from how to handle uncomfortable workplace situations (answer: with grace) to how she met her husband (a mutual friend). Thanks to Michelle for taking time out of her busy schedule to meet with us and share some of her story!</p>
<p>Since late 2012, Gilt&rsquo;s women technologists have been meeting informally to discuss leadership skills, work/life balance, and professional development. Our activities include reading books either by or for businesswomen, attending public events for women in technology, and working with nonprofits that aim to create more opportunities in technology for women and girls. On July 11 we&rsquo;ll host <a href="http://www.girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a>, an organization that promotes &ldquo;gender parity in the computing fields.&rdquo; More on Girls Who Code at Gilt to come in a future post!</p>

    <p><span><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/8ad83dbe220ae27c5b90b8fe0823f622/tumblr_inline_mpa0q8YRKT1qz4rgp.jpg"/></span></p>

<p><span>Underneath the glowing purple lights of NYU’s Rosenthal Pavilion, a crowd of more than 400 people gathered last night for “Made in NY: Tech Panel,” a discussion of the state of Silicon Alley affairs. The panel featured seven prominent, NYC-based tech leaders: <strong>Gilt</strong> CTO and Co-founder Michael Bryzek, <strong>ZocDoc</strong> CTO &amp; Co-founder Nick Ganju, <strong>Etsy</strong> CTO Kellan Elliott-McCrea, <strong>Knewton</strong> COO David Liu, <strong>Charity: Water</strong> Tech Director Brian Honohan, <strong>LearnVest</strong> CTO Hrishi Dixit, and moderator Alex Cavoulacos, COO of <strong>The Muse</strong>. For more than an hour, the panelists shared their thoughts, wisdom, and experiences on topics ranging from culture, technology, scaling, retention and the growing tech scenes both here in New York and in Dublin.</span></p>
<p><strong>Among the many highlights:</strong></p>
<p><em>Bryzek’s brief yet thought-provoking discussion of antifragility</em><span>, a concept discussed by scholar, NYU professor and author Nassim Nicholas Taleb in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/1400067820" target="_blank"><em>Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder</em></a>. Just as the “right” amount of stress, strain and uncertainty can all strengthen a person’s muscles or character, so too can they strengthen a company. At Gilt, we face “a constant stream of errors,” Bryzek told the audience, “but they’re so small, and people are always fixing them.” With systems in place to account for and manage mistakes, Gilt gets stronger every single day. </span></p>
<p><span><em>The panelists’ candor in discussing hiring and firing</em>. </span><span>“Hire as fast as you can. Fire faster,” Liu from Knewton told the audience. Being lackadaisical about offboarding a hire who isn’t working out can endanger your team’s motivation and morale. “You’re not only avoiding the issue, you’re condoning it,” he asserted. As for picking the right people, Liu suggests hiring “as though it’s your last hire.” Ganju of ZocDoc added to Liu’s points by describing his personal “litmus test” for retaining an employee. If he were to create another company, would he take that employee with him? If not, then why keep them at his current company? </span></p>
<p><span>Bryzek joked that “of course at Gilt, we’ve never made any mistakes in hiring.” He then touched upon one of the more poignant issues Gilt has occasionally faced over the years: Sometimes the right people have shown up at the wrong time in the company’s life cycle. When it’s necessary to part ways, he said, Gilt’s goal is to come up with a way for both parties to split on “incredibly good” terms. “It’s work, but it’s doable,” he said. He also noted that some people have left Gilt voluntarily, only to return and forge successful careers. </span></p>
<p><em>Retention tips</em>. With a tech market as competitive as New York City’s, keeping your best employees can be just as difficult as hiring the right ones. If your star engineers aren’t being barraged with phone calls from persistent tech recruiters, then they’re probably spending their off-hours creating their own companies. What’s an employer to do? One by one, the panelists formulated a solid working answer: encourage personal growth, create a culture of learning, give your employees opportunities to work on their own projects, and strive for a culture of transparency.</p>
<p>“Made in NY” was just as informal as it was informational, with lots of subtle tech humor and witticisms to keep the discussion lively and spontaneous. After Cavoulacos asked the panel about technologies one should consider when building a company, Bryzek pitched the audience on the Typesafe framework of Scala, Play and Akka&ndash;the platform that we love and use here at Gilt. “There’s no other way to do it,” he said wryly.</p>

    <p><strong><img alt="image" height="597" src="http://media.tumblr.com/2ed1ffcd6443d219b0a7909dc1d473b9/tumblr_inline_mp41opBDCg1qz4rgp.jpg" width="800"/></strong></p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-6becb254-8b65-1355-add1-b86006e2a98c"><strong>What’s your role at Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>I’m a software engineer who specializes in front-end technologies. I work with designers of the visual and UX varieties to sculpt an idea for a product, then I implement the front-end of that product. My weeks are always different, depending on the phase of the product.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tell us how you got here.<br/></strong></p>
<p><span>In 2011, I was contacted by a recruiter via LinkedIn. I had never heard of Gilt and didn’t know anything about the company, but the recruiter described some of the projects being worked on here and it sounded pretty exciting. I thought, &lsquo;I should talk to these guys.&rsquo; </span></p>
<p><span>I went through Gilt’s incredibly rigorous interview process&ndash;four phone calls and a five-hour interview during which I talked to at least four engineers plus [SVP Engineering and Product Strategy John] Quinn. Five hour-long conversations about everything from databases to API development.</span><br/><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Before you came to Gilt, you moved around a bit. Where did you live?</strong></p>
<p><span>I was born in Arkansas, then moved to Michigan, then back to Arkansas, where I went to college. Then I moved to China for a year, Florida one year, then to New Orleans. I became a Hurricane Katrina refugee and went back to China from 2006 to 2009, then moved to New York City.</span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><strong>What did you do in China?</strong></p>
<p><span>The first two years I taught English. Then a friend who’d moved to Nanjing started a school that offered high school-level courses needed a computer teacher. I was promoted to chair of the ICT department and worked there for three years. Then I came here.</span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><span>China is a great place to visit and live for a while, but it’s difficult to make a life for yourself as a foreigner. New York City is a liberating place fashion-wise&ndash;it’s easy to express yourself.</span></p>
<p><strong>Speaking of fashion: When did you start wearing suits to work?</strong></p>
<p><span>It started when I lived in China. I have a body shape that isn’t conducive to the Chinese clothing market, so I had to rely on tailors for a lot of things: shirts, ties, vests. Having clothing tailored in China was quite easy. Also, the school where I worked had a dress code, so for the first time in my professional life I had to wear a collar and tie. I thought I’d embrace it. </span></p>
<p><strong>Would you still dress up for work even if you telecommuted?</strong></p>
<p><span>I would have to put on something&ndash;construct an outfit before I could get myself into a mental state for work. I think I’ve always been this way&ndash;in high school I was very into punk rock, chains, safety pins and dyed hair, then grunge before that. I’ve always made choices about my appearance.</span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><span>For whatever reason I no longer feel comfortable working in T-shirts and jeans. I feel like I can’t get into a mindset of crafting something, can’t pour my heart into something, wearing T-shirts and jeans. </span><span></span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><strong>How has working at a fashion-conscious company influenced your personal style?</strong></p>
<p><span>Working at Gilt gives me inspiration that I didn’t have at previous jobs. It’s a great opportunity.</span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><span>Fashion really is about expressing yourself. Some people view that as a sort of an elitist or undemocratic stance, but every human expresses themselves through the clothing that they wear. Some people have more privileged choices than others, of course.</span><br/><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>What are some of your favorite brands featured on Gilt?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Alexander Olch is one I definitely keep coming back to&ndash;their ties, pocket squares and other things are beautiful. Recently I’ve been enjoying Sebastian Grey out of Chicago. I discovered them through <a href="http://www.giltcity.com" target="_blank">Gilt City</a> and have been back to them several times. I’m wearing their suit right now, actually.  </span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><strong>And Martin Greenfield?</strong></p>
<p><span>Martin Greenfield is America’s finest living tailor, hands-down.</span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><span>Most people assume I have way more suits than I do, but a man doesn’t need that many suits&ndash;two or three will do. At most, I’ve maybe had five at one time. Manhattan closets aren’t forgiving enough to accommodate lots of suits. You need shirts and accessories&ndash;that’s the expression part. Rather than trying to pull off a loud suit every day I prefer a good suit with lots of accessories.</span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><strong>What is your approach to accessorizing? <br/></strong></p>
<p><span>To my mind, you can’t really build an outfit without starting with your shoes, at least in Manhattan. It’s the first fashion choice you should make in the morning. My favorites from Gilt are Maurizi, Two Boot, Grenson. My favorite Gilt purchase of late is a pair of blue brogue Antonio Maurizi shoes that is just fantastic. I’m not sure what magic Italians apply to shoes, but they’re just so good. </span></p>
<p><span>Wingtip Clothiers have some very exciting pocket squares, ties, and accessories. And J. Crew&ndash;I love everything they do. Cannot get enough of them.</span></p>
<p><strong>And hats?</strong></p>
<p><span>Worth &amp; Worth in Manhattan&ndash;their hats are made here. And the JJ Hat Center on 5th Avenue is also good. Worth &amp; Worth has had a factory in Manhattan for almost 100 years. </span></p>
<p><strong>How is your approach to fashion similar to your approach to engineering and design?</strong></p>
<p><span>I try to approach my work holistically, and give consideration to history and convention. Then I look for ways to twist it and surprise and delight in the details. As far as what I do every day, I try to push the envelope and sort of get away from established methods. </span></p>
<p><strong>You’ve initiated some projects to help reduce the distance between design and engineering. Tell us about those.</strong></p>
<p><span>I feel that that distance between design and engineering is too great. We have these two disciplines that need to work in total balance to produce. In 2012 I put together an eight-week summer course called “Web Literacy” that was targeted toward our visual and UX designers. The class met for two hours every Monday evening. </span></p>
<p><strong>What was the result of that course?</strong></p>
<p><span>One thing was that it led me to teach at Parsons, the New School for Design. This past semester I was a part-time instructor for a 15-week, sophomore-level course called “Core Interaction Design.” I taught the lab component; there was also a studio component.</span><br/><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>What do you enjoy most about working at Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>It’s refreshing to A., not have someone checking up on you every hour to see what you’re doing, and B., not be given explicit directions, which means there’s a lot of freedom to make your own choices and mistakes. A lot of companies say, 'we hire great people and trust them,&rsquo; but I actually </span><span>feel </span><span>that here. Everybody here is super-great at what they do. Everyone’s smarter than I am, and that’s a great place to be. </span></p>
<p><strong>Where do you see us shining the most?</strong></p>
<p>We could play an important role in advancing <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank">Scala</a> and the <a href="http://www.playframework.com/" target="_blank">Play</a> framework. Our distribution is cutting-edge, our customer service is incredible. We’re investing a lot into personalization. When we really hit it home with personalization, I think no one can touch us.</p>

<p>Tonight (Thu 6/27) Gilt CTO Michael Bryzek will appear alongside tech leaders from Knewton, ZocDoc and other NYC-based companies at &ldquo;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/techinmotionnyc/events/123058112/" target="_blank">Made in NY: Tech Panel</a>,&rdquo; an event hosted by Tech in Motion. Bryzek and the other panelists will discuss <span>building a tech team from scratch, the future of NYC&rsquo;s tech scene, and why NYC is such a great place to start a tech company, among other topics. Seven hundred people signed up for the event, and (as of this typing) another 54 are still waiting to gain admission. In fact, the response was so overwhelming that the organizers had to move the event to a much larger location to accommodate more people. Impressive! </span></p>
<p><span>Thanks to Tech in Motion for inviting Gilt to take part in what promises to be a lively and enlightening discussion. We&rsquo;ll follow up with a recap, so stay tuned!<br/></span></p>
