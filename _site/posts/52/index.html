<p><a href="http://basho.com/" target="_blank">Basho</a> has just published video from its recent <a href="http://ricon.io/archive/2013/east.html" target="_blank">RICON East 2013</a> conference in NYC—including this video from my talk, <em>Scaling Happiness Horizontally</em>. In my presentation, I discuss Gilt’s approach to scaling our distributed organization and spend a fair bit of time discussing the contents of our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/03/07/scaling-agile-at-gilt-with-teams-ingredients" target="_blank"><em>Scaling Agile at Gilt</em></a> blog post—specifically, our methods of modeling our application architecture to influence team communication structures. There are a lot of similarities between scaling distributed computing systems and scaling organizations. (Gilt Tech is a distributed, peer-to-peer network.)</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/c55a00e492126d8bd293e8c37ddf9bf4/tumblr_inline_moyggntwUY1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>

<p>Gilt Tech is proud to announce that the Project Management Committee at <a href="denied:%E2%80%9Dhttp://cloudstack.apache.org/%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">Apache CloudStack</a> has invited Gilt cofounder Phong Nguyen to become a committer. Phong’s new role, writes PMC member David Nalley, is “a recognition of his participation &hellip; and commitment to the project and the Apache Way.” As a committer, Phong will be able to submit changes autonomously and commit directly to the master branch. “The CloudStack community is a great bunch of folks,&ldquo; Phong says, &quot;and we&rsquo;re excited to be a part of that community and be able to help out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phong started working on the CloudStack project early this year, after Gilt Tech’s infrastructure and engineering team held a summit at our Dublin office to discuss private cloud solutions. Our team was looking for a virtualization technology that could manage our virtual machines while sustaining even performance under high load each day at noon EST. We were also looking for a new user interface and API. The team tested <a href="http://lxc.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Linux Containers</a> (LXC), a virtual systems mechanism that groups multiple processes into lightweight containers and runs them off the same kernel. Our engineers liked LXC, especially because it has near bare metal performance when running multiple containers.</p>
<p>As part of our effort to fully automate our deployment system, Gilt&rsquo;s engineers also considered a variety of cloud orchestration software to manage VMs. “CloudStack really stood out for us during our evaluations, but it didn’t support LXC,” Phong says. “We decided to move forward with the best fit and add LXC support to CloudStack.” Phong took the lead on the LXC project&ndash;“my first major open source contribution,” he says. As part of his work, Phong asked questions on CloudStack forums, attended gatherings of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/CloudStack-NYC-User-Group/" target="_blank">CloudStack NYC User Group</a>, read mailing lists, and attended Apache’s North American conference earlier this year. In April, he submitted the patch (and related documentation) to officially add LXC to CloudStack. As a side benefit of his work, he met members of the CloudStack PMC, who invited him to become a committer in May.</p>
<p>Phong’s LXC work is slated for release in CloudStack 4.2 (the current version is 4.1). He’s looking forward to being a committer, he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled that the CloudStack project accepted our patches. We are currently very bullish on CloudStack and LXC and look forward to more open source tooling to support the platform as a service.&rdquo;</p>

    <img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_mopypknfw41qgexq2o1_1280.jpg"/><br/><p>The 27 day beer challenge is underway!</p>
<p>When we launched gilt.com back in 2007, every product and sale photo we took was stored on a shared NFS mount point. We&rsquo;re now creating terabytes of data each month and it&rsquo;s finally time to move our images to s3. We&rsquo;re also changing how we create and manage our image sizing and crops - moving away from image magick and integrating with <a href="http://www.imgix.com/" target="_blank">http://www.imgix.com/</a> - an amazing new startup doing image manipulation in the GPU.</p>
<p>Our internal goal is to build the new image management services, update our internal image tooling, and migrate all our images to s3 in 27 days. To keep track of progress - we have 27 unique bottles of great beer from all over the world (note only a portion visible in photo above). At the end of each day, we share a beer to mark our progress.</p>
<p>When the beer is gone, our images will be stored in s3 and served by imgix&hellip; And along the way, the 27 beer challenge has provided a really fun way to end each day in the office!</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/06/21/meet-a-gilt-technologist-nithya-venkateswaran">Meet a Gilt Technologist: Nithya Venkateswaran, Quality Assurance Engineer</a></h1>
  
  <header>
    
    <time>21 June 2013</time>
    
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/ee68ed92d66d932b13cac261c6136008/tumblr_inline_mor5f2KESJ1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>

<p><strong>How did you get into Quality Assurance?</strong></p>
<p>I worked as a developer in India, then earned my master&rsquo;s degree in Management Information Systems in Arkansas. After I finished my degree, my first job was at Yahoo! That was a QA position, and so my career became geared toward QA.</p>
<p><strong>How did you arrive at Gilt?</strong></p>
<p>In early 2010, someone from Gilt reached out to me online. At the time I was living in Washington, DC. During the interview process, I made a purchase to see how the site worked. I thought, ‘this is such a great concept!&rsquo; I still have what I bought the first time: a pair of lounge pants.</p>
<p><strong>When did you start working here? </strong></p>
<p>I joined Gilt in March 2010 as an automation engineer, doing QA automation. My job was to create new test cases for automation for different parts of the site&ndash;both front-end and back-end. I then did automation at Gilt City for a year. Earlier this year I switched back to Gilt to join the International team.</p>
<p><strong>Which technologies have you used most at Gilt?</strong></p>
<p>When I started here, we used Java and Selenium; most of our automation framework was built on Java as well. We still use Selenium, but with Scala now.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve been learning Scala on your own, correct?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. So far mostly everything that I’ve wanted to learn has been through internal chats, <a href="https://twitter.com/odersky" target="_blank">Martin Odersky</a>’s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun" target="_blank">Coursera course</a>, and my colleagues’ help. With Scala, as with any programming language, you learn more by doing and getting your hands dirty.</p>
<p><strong>What do you like about Scala?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve only been studying it for a few months, but already I see that it’s more concise than Java. Scala lets you mix object-orientation and functional programming, and it’s easy and fun to learn.</p>
<p><strong>What else have you been studying and learning here? </strong></p>
<p>Gilt is so open about learning &ndash; people support you and make it as easy as possible. Recently I’ve been learning how to use <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/cognos/" target="_blank">Cognos</a>, a data warehouse tool. It’s not required for my job, but I told my mentor that I wanted to learn more about the business side of the work I do for International. He helped me to gain access to the Cognos system and so I could learn how to create dashboards and understand the core international business better.</p>
<p>This brings me to Gilt’s mentorship program: It’s definitely very helpful to everyone who wants to make use of it. My mentor meets with me regularly to help me work on my primary and secondary goals. This sort of guidance definitely helps us to understand how our work directly affects the growth of the company.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us more about the International team.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been on this amazing team for almost six months now, and feel really lucky to be a part of it. We’ve grown so fast, and we have so much potential. Everyone on our team is awesome at what they do, and we are always brainstorming about how to make the international experience more beautiful and seamless for our customers.</p>
<p><strong>What are your goals going forward?</strong></p>
<p>I’m very interested in product management. I’d like to work on solving some of those bigger business challenges, to help Gilt grow.</p>
<p><strong>How has Gilt helped you move toward achieving your goals?</strong></p>
<p>Last year, after I told my manager that I wanted to move into product management, he helped me take a one-week executive education course at UC Berkeley. The course helped me learn all about product management concepts and processes, and was a great experience. When I came back from California, I got to lead a subscriber registration model project for Gilt City.</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe Gilt Tech’s work environment?</strong></p>
<p>Creative, open, friendly. We don’t have walls or private offices, and there is no bureaucracy. It’s very easy to ask members of the executive team for their input and feedback on ideas. I love how we have things like a Gilt Tech Women group, where women can talk about our experiences, share and learn from each other openly, and read books by other women in technology and business.</p>
<p>There’s also a focus on substance here. We have KPIs to measure exactly how we’re contributing to the company. And we obviously care about using the best technologies, and meeting our own high standards.</p>
<p><strong>What do you do outside of work?</strong></p>
<p>I do improv and am taking kickboxing and storytelling classes. I also just received my competent communicator certificate from <a href="http://www.toastmasters.org/" target="_blank">Toastmasters International</a>. I joined Toastmasters for personal growth&ndash;to be a good product manager, you have to be a good speaker.</p>
<p>I feel that everyone at Gilt is passionate about pursuing their personal interests. It helps you grow in your company&ndash;you remain open to different sources of inspiration. The company appreciates work-life balance. It means that they actually care about you.</p>

    <p>As an organization, we&rsquo;re able to provide more value to our customers and adapt to changes more effectively when developers can focus on coding and not on other tasks which can be automated instead. On Tuesday, I spoke at <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/" target="_blank">Open Source Bridge</a> about “Innovating Faster with a Micro-Service Architecture using SBT, Continuous Delivery, and LXC.&ldquo; In the talk, I discussed some of the development and operational infrastructure we&rsquo;ve created at Gilt to support the rapid development of new features while simultaneously evolving our architecture from a monolithic Rails application to a constellation of over 200 microservices and small web applications.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>What do books, programming languages and cars have in common? They enter our lives carrying that proverbial “new smell”: the elusive but potent combination of possibilities, expectations and hopes that “this one will be better than the last.” Sometimes it fades quickly because of poor quality or unfortunate design choices, but every once in awhile the initial excitement matures into something that keeps you coming back for more—the first small, joyful step turns into a happy little walk, and then becomes a journey.</p>

<p>Scala seems to be one of those languages with deep, powerful abstractions and an ever-expanding toolbox. It lures you in with simple, borderline magical examples, and then keeps you engaged by revealing something new and intellectually delicious at every step. The learning curve can be steep, but it’s ultimately rewarding. When you move past “hello worlds” and simple web applications, a question inevitably arises: “Am I doing it right? Is this what good Scala code is supposed to look like?”</p>

<p>Scala creator <a href="https://twitter.com/odersky" target="_blank">Martin Odersky</a> tried to answer that very question in “Scala with Style,” his keynote address at this year’s <a href="http://scaladays.org" target="_blank">Scala Days</a> conference (organized by <a href="http://typesafe.com/" target="_blank">Typesafe</a> and sponsored by Gilt). The same concern was echoed by <a href="https://twitter.com/dickwall" target="_blank">Dick Wall</a> in his excellent talk about simple API design. I find it telling that, instead of wooing the crowd with something clever, specialized and highly technical, Odersky and Wall instead chose to focus on a topic that’s softer yet more difficult, less well defined and more controversial: how to write good code.</p>

<p>All of this year’s Scala Days talks were recorded, and Typesafe has promised to post them online at <a href="http://parleys.com/" target="_blank">Parleys</a> sometime soon. I highly recommend watching both presentations whenever they become available. I couldn’t possibly do them justice by summarizing the contents, so instead I’d like to share the one point that stood out in my mind, and illustrate it with a couple of code examples.</p>

<p>While talking about language design choices, Odersky mentioned the following:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Scala combines elements from both object-oriented and functional programming methodologies;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scala is expressive;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scala is un-opinionated.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>To put that into a sentence: “<strong>Scala empowers you to express what <em>you</em> think is important, not what the language designer deems important</strong>.” <em>You</em> need to decide what values, preferences and character traits will show through the code you write. To elaborate:</p>

<ul><li>
<p>Maybe you are good at holding many things in your head at once, and like to write incredibly long map-flatMap-filter-combinator statements using infix notation for fun and profit;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe you are adept at manipulating complex functional abstract entities like it’s Play-Doh. I am not sure exactly what that would look like, but it sounds like a way to win bets at Functional Programming meetups;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe you have a crush on monads and cannot live without them;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe “Concurrency” is your middle name, and you are physically unable to write code without Actors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe you love clean code, and confusingly named methods that stretch over more than 15 lines make you cry.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>If that last point about clean code resonates with you, then Scala could be a great fit: we don’t have to tailor our code to “robots” as much as when programming in some other languages. A lot of clever engineering went into Scala to support flexible syntax, type inference and the like. With all that tech under the hood, we can afford to reallocate some of our brain cycles toward creating more “human-friendly” code. Here is some advice from Martin Odersky and Dick Wall:</p>

<p><strong>Pick meaningful names for classes, functions and variables.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Use inline def’s and val’s to name intermediate results.</strong></p>

<p>Compare the following two pieces of code (sorry for the lousy formatting):</p>

<pre><code>accounts.filter(_.getUserId == userId)
    .flatMap(_.getDeposits)
    .map( tx =&gt;
      CurrencyConvertors.getConvertorFrom(tx.getCurrency)
        .amountInUSD(tx.getAmount)
    ).sum
</code></pre>

<p>vs.</p>

<pre><code>val usersDeposits = accounts.filter(_.getUserId == userId)
      .flatMap(_.getDeposits)

def convertAmountToUSD(tx: Transaction) =
      CurrencyConvertors.getConvertorFrom(tx.getCurrency)
          .amountInUSD(tx.getAmount)

usersDeposits map convertAmountToUSD sum
</code></pre>

<p>The introduction of inline <code>val</code> and <code>def</code> makes it easier to understand what’s happening in the second code snippet, because the very last line captures the intent of the whole block.</p>

<p><strong>Use infix notation sparingly.</strong></p>

<p>The following code is from one of the keynote slides. If the line got any longer in the first example, you’d be in danger of losing your train of thought half-way through&ndash;especially because one of the variables is named <code>filter</code>, which can be confused with <code>Iterable.filter()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>mapping add filter map second flatMap third
xs map f mkString
</code></pre>

<p>vs.</p>

<pre><code>mapping.add(filter).map(second).flatMap(third)
xs.map(f).mkString
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Be careful with operators.</strong></p>

<pre><code>something &lt;++= blah
(z /: xs)(op)
</code></pre>

<p>vs.</p>

<pre><code>???
(xs.foldLeft(z))(op)
</code></pre>

<p>Think about your audience. Will people who read your code (or, just as importantly, your future self) know what you meant by &ldquo;<code>&lt;++="</code>? It’s a real Scala function defined in some package, but I can’t tell you what it does because I didn’t catch its description, and it’s impossible to find on Google. Unless you are sure that readers of your code will understand it, don’t use it.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t hesitate to use var’s to capture local mutable state if it makes code clearer.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Don’t nest many levels deep.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Favor simplicity over cleverness.</strong></p>

<p>Given how powerful Scala is, and how easy it is to write complex code, it’s important to spend time on readability and simplicity. Remember that Scala is all about choices, and it’s up to <em>you</em> to make the right ones.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Video recordings of ScalaDays 2013 talks are now <a href="http://parleys.com/channel/51ae1022e4b01033a7e4b6ca/presentations" target="_blank">available online</a>.</p>

    <p><strong><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/de82993a91aa8f1d14019c5ee38843b0/tumblr_inline_moe2o44coo1qz4rgp.jpg" width="800"/></strong></p>
<p><strong>How did you arrive at Gilt?</strong></p>
<p>I first came to Gilt while I was a student at the University of Waterloo in Canada (I’m Canadian). Our school runs a program in which computer science students complete six four-month internships over five years. I did my Gilt internship from September to December 2011, during my senior year.</p>
<p><strong>What was your role here?</strong></p>
<p>I was part of the Gilt City engineering team, working as a software engineer.</p>
<p><strong>What was it like to be a Gilt intern?</strong></p>
<p>I was able to interact with a lot of senior engineers as well as the vice president of engineering, and I learned a lot about the different roles team members fulfill. My supervisors gave me direct feedback on my work, which always helped. There’s just a lot of transparency here—I was on a small team, which allowed me to gain exposure to high-level details about what was going on in the company. Working on a small team also made it easier to see how my work made sense in the big picture.</p>
<p><strong>How did you make your return?</strong></p>
<p>After I graduated from Waterloo, I decided I’d like to come back to Gilt. When I graduated I followed up with Peter Bakhirev, who had been my internship supervisor, and asked if there were any opportunities. Gilt had some job openings, so Peter and I had a conversation and I ended up coming back.</p>
<p><strong>While you were gone, how had Gilt or its culture changed?</strong></p>
<p>One thing that has been changing with Gilt City more recently is that we’re moving toward taking the lead on our tech architecture—one that’s separate from the larger Gilt tech department, but follows the same best practices. This means that there’s a lot of work that needs to be done. I think the changes are interesting because they’re helping us to facilitate more cooperation between tech and business groups, and that helps us drive business growth. We’re creating something independent for ourselves, so we can make more independent decisions.</p>
<p><strong>What do you like best about Gilt’s culture?</strong></p>
<p>What I appreciate about Gilt is that it’s very safe to bring up new ideas and receive feedback. I also like that there are no private offices. For two years I worked as an accountant doing audits and taxes, and in that industry, partners and senior staff work in private offices, so you don’t always get to interact with them. It’s just how the industry works. It’s very different here—as a tech company, everybody’s very accessible and open to having conversations with the people across the hall. It’s something I think Gilt should be proud of. Even though Gilt has become a large company, it hasn’t lost its down-to-earth quality.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts on mentoring at Gilt?</strong></p>
<p>I have a one-on-one session with Peter every week or two weeks to talk about my personal development and to let him know if I’m interested in anything else outside my current list of responsibilities. There are a lot of opportunities to switch projects, so I can get exposure to all the facets of my team’s functions. You can also switch teams here, which helps you to adapt to different work and management styles.</p>
<p><strong>What are your career goals?</strong></p>
<p>My primary short-term goal is to deepen my knowledge of different technologies and improve my learning speed.</p>
<p><strong>And long-term?</strong></p>
<p>I am very interested in entrepreneurship. Before joining Gilt, I had built several websites. One of them was an online community for my school, and it ended up serving over a million views. Seeing many people using my product felt really good, and I wanted to experience that more. I then participated in an incubator, where I worked on another venture with seed funding and mentors to learn more about entrepreneurship. I hope I develop a variety of skills and build relationships here at Gilt to become a better entrepreneur.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think working at Gilt will help you to become a better entrepreneur?</strong></p>
<p>Despite its size, Gilt maintains an entrepreneurial spirit. There are a lot of experiments going on, and many decisions involve taking a lot of risks. I get to see what works and what doesn’t. It’s still a relatively young company. I think there’s a lot here for people who might want to be an entrepreneur someday—you can make lifelong connections and learn critical skills.</p>

<p>Symmetry is a fundamental feature of math, physics, biology, art, architecture, music and many other things. In &ldquo;Scala &amp; Symmetry,&rdquo; Gilt&rsquo;s <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">Tuesday</span></span> lunchtime talk at <a href="http://scaladays.org/" target="_blank">Scala Days</a>, Gilt VP Architecture Eric Bowman mined for symmetry in Scala, comparing Java and Scala and identifying where the inherent symmetry in Scala leads to much more robust code. Eric also examined the role of asymmetry, and how striking the right balance between asymmetry and symmetry paves the way for writing great code and building great systems.</p>
