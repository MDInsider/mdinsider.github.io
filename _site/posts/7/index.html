  <h1><a href="/2014/11/11/a-synthetic-monitoring-case-study">A Synthetic Monitoring Case Study</a></h1>
  
  <header>
    
    <time>11 November 2014</time>
    
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Client-side web application monitoring comes in two main flavors. Real User Monitoring, or RUM, uses an agent that runs within each web page and reports on the page load data for every request. Typically, the browser’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Navigation_timing" target="_blank">performance timing API</a> data is used. Gilt uses <a href="http://newrelic.com/" target="_blank">New Relic</a> for RUM, and it provides a good overview of the application ecosystem. In the old forest/tree metaphor, it’s the forest.</p>
<p>Synthetic monitoring does not run in the web application. Rather, synthetic monitoring vendors provide remote hardware that hits a web site periodically, and stores data for what it sees on that particular request. It’s “synthetic” because it’s not your users’ data; requests are made specifically for collecting data on your page loads. But it’s also controlled. The requests are made from predictable hardware over predictable connections. If RUM is the forest, synthetic monitoring is the trees.</p>
<p>Gilt has been using <a href="http://rigor.com/" target="_blank">Rigor</a> for synthetic monitoring. It’s interesting to see how the data from each kind of monitoring provides a different perspective on the health of an application.</p>
<h3>Different Perspectives</h3>
<p>RUM collects data on every web request from every customer. So it’s big data, and our view of that data is going to be broad and not deep. For example, average page load times include every hit to the page, cached requests and uncached requests. These averages make it more difficult to see performance problems when they happen. The following is the performance of our <a href="http://www.gilt.com/sale/women" target="_blank">sale listing page</a> for a month in New Relic:</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7b8c02fa-9fad-6ef9-17ae-376adb6bc441"><img alt="image" height="433px;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zW2W7HePp9Kg8a_axD4WGfp0aG1ZOhJFUAA-5p8XXntDxrwrXglc-dp907zD2ROWb5PZxyMhyc5pp4IvEveQoHM8i_2P5dKfYKXHk6mne_uP_q7bkKhREbhSHkZss5mzuW9s" width="868px;"/></span></p>
<p>Unlike RUM, synthetic monitoring is always dealing with a single uncached request from consistent hardware. This makes it much easier to see when a change affects performance. The following is a single request to the same sale listing page, for the same time period.</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7b8c0301-9fae-2e1b-908e-43cbd8253947"><img alt="image" height="385px;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SenGnoHAb38k5dOSqI-Yo9_o7R3NpV4dCmOpZ970WJWYXI0C58_IFwYeOWi_eeFIkUCMdyQJ2eVACEvgRcMQUM6I8DUFlLgW85FTvH3Z1rLf370jna2NleZgiNcIHcPLOUOX" width="885px;"/></span></p>
<p>Looks different, doesn’t it? There are obvious spikes and valleys. When we layer the two images on top of each other, we see that one really significant spike in the synthetic chart doesn’t even register on the RUM chart:</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7b8c03bc-9fae-66e0-3148-6c34db797111"><img alt="image" height="497px;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/zKYvzC3fsJ7BlOODcvQleqKKubNPywETmzZEZEStiZiRbLdybmC__6JlFDMP45c5TCFkVWWRbclXO5hK5GUpaNXlleFy37CRNHdJjniNgy5zfPTnX4agHX9sEKAzdNnNK4D6" width="910px;"/>So which type of monitoring should we use? The answer is YES. Both RUM and synthetic monitoring give different views of our performance, and are useful for different things. RUM helps us understand long-term trends, and synthetic monitoring helps us diagnose and solve shorter-term performance problems.</span></p>
<h3>Case Study</h3>
<p>Around October 1, I noticed an uptick in our sale listing page load time in Rigor. Incidentally, this is the same spike that above didn&rsquo;t really show up on the New Relic RUM chart.</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7b8c031b-9fae-9f42-6814-f1ea69acaefb"><img alt="image" height="298px;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/M6Qkhe0LFFux7686noIwVSN86-siusqgw_VflTEjUbcYRsUABu3Wx-C_uFtyaNWlUTHN23ryxBPzWedkQHnnTjoH9XDXqHnGsMxXHGiZdr0OVuYBwNDv-MCVL5lag1GBkP6M" width="794px;"/></span></p>
<p>Looking through the git log of the repo, I didn’t see anything too suspicious. I then isolated the deployed git tag in which the change happened and performed a diff between that tag and the previous tag, comparing their frozen package.json files (containing the fully resolved AMD module versions). That showed a couple of possibilities, so I started looking into Rigor’s data.</p>
<p>Synthetic monitoring tools generally give access to the waterfall charts for every page load. So, I isolated a few waterfalls prior to the uptick and a few following the uptick. What I found: an additional 25 images and a couple of additional requests. I was pretty sure I had my smoking gun.</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7b8c0337-9fae-f1e0-f303-b7c1346ae248"><img alt="image" height="379px;" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Tnkb3L3yHIMH4CapIJpqASgKIj6z1tEaAGcdzy0XYTXK7r6xGo5BJVkIo2Q2Nngj7Zhx13deNOdopOnpuoS3LH344RcRya9XtrEr_Hvkc8kDoTV77rh1XFGQWz7xQIvLiXXP" width="686px;"/></span></p>
<p>The culprit was most likely a new AMD module, called <code>component.trending_products</code>. Its job is to request products that our customers are currently buying in real time. This is a great feature for our customers, but at this point seemed to be adding upwards of a second of load time to our pages.</p>
<h3>Confirming the Suspicion</h3>
<p>Fortunately, synthetic monitoring is very good at showing us data around things even if customers are not seeing them. I was able to create an A/B test using our configuration service and use it to disable the feature for any visitor with a certain query parameter. This allowed me to run a synthetic test for a few days, which made it very clear this new feature was the problem. You can see that the lines move parallel to each other, with the only slight exception indicating a load time outlier that affected the average and 90%/95%/99% lines.</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7b8c0359-9fc4-9010-1412-a01bc62cd3c8"><img alt="image" height="404px;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LDTudKjWNCzKjbOdaiX-5HIvvkXu12ty5ILr2NHJ3vH1siln4S5BVokt5_xb2c2Bl8Ap2NvRmxQdxOUlidMwHRdpjY5QYIG9pByRstzYqkelAx-G8kO9bWohBnwOuIJAPHmT" width="859px;"/></span></p>
<h3>Solving the Problem</h3>
<p>Fortunately, issues like these are relatively simple to improve.</p>
<p>The first problem is the number of images. The component fetches JSON data from a service endpoint, runs it through a Handlebars template, and injects the resulting HTML into the page. The data source can contain any number of products to show to the user; typically around 25-30. But the product images are displayed in a carousel:</p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-7b8c0377-9faf-32cb-240e-5fc9a0143626"><img alt="image" height="496px;" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/U-KatRLQchJhwDJ4HUGwQu2yevINTTElbZc5ULCfn-S4LY4aooTBXOBbrXDOdqmoNIZrQD7psjcFsL8aXyqVI5LnCvR9rAgdOieiNVcPaLG_x610JF2S70s72dobuUkPO6hA" width="741px;"/></span></p>
<p>As much as we’d like to tell ourselves otherwise, most users are not going to advance the carousel to look at additional products, so there’s really no need to load the image data for the images that are off-screen. This is easily accomplished with a template like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;img data-gilt-src="/path/to/image" /&gt;</pre>
<p>This way, the image URI is in the rendered HTML. Of course, since none of the images have src attributes, I didn’t have any images showing on page load. The next step: activate the visible ones immediately after the template renders and is injected. (In the code below, the <code>pageSize</code> variable was created using <code>window.matchMedia</code> and was equal to the number of carousel items showing at each screen resolution.)</p>
<pre>target.find('img[data-gilt-src]').each(function (i) {
  if (i &lt; pageSize) {
    $(this).attr('src', $(this).attr('data-gilt-src'));
    $(this).removeAttr('data-gilt-src');
  }
});
</pre>
<p>The images also were missing their quality parameter. We use a service provided by our CDN to compress our JPGs slightly, which saves roughly 30% on the file transfer. Adding ?oq=85 to the image immediately reduces the bandwidth going over the wire.</p>
<p>Finally, I just needed a little bit of JavaScript to load additional images when the user interacts with the carousel. I was able to use our carousel’s API to do this (<code>element</code> is already in scope as the carousel container):</p>
<pre>carousel.subscribe('elementSwitched', function (data) {
  element.find('img[data-gilt-src]').each(function (i) {
    $(this).attr('src', $(this).attr('data-gilt-src'));
    $(this).removeAttr('data-gilt-src');
  });
}</pre>
<p>Loading all of the images at this point makes sense no matter how many carousel pages there are. By the time the user is interacting with the carousel, it’s a fairly safe assumption that the page is done loading and that there isn&rsquo;t too much other HTTP traffic.</p>
<p>All these changes can&rsquo;t eliminate the load time involved in adding a new feature to a page. However, you can certainly tell from the chart below when the fixes were released, which is a continuation of the earlier chart showing just the A/B test variants. The decrease of all load times is actually unrelated; it&rsquo;s the coming together of the two lines, with and without the trending products feature, that shows the improvement.</p>

<p><span>As time has passed, this new feature has settled into adding about 150ms to the page load, which is reasonable for the additional customer benefit it provides.</span></p>
<p><span>Synthetic monitoring provides a perspective on your application that RUM can&rsquo;t. The controlled environment makes problems more visible, and also gives you the opportunity to test your hypotheses and make corrections without requiring customer traffic. This case study confirmed for us the usefulness of synthetic monitoring, and we&rsquo;re excited to integrate the tool into our workflow more in the future, including testing the performance of new features before we send customer traffic to them.</span></p>

<p>Gilt recently had the incredible honor of hosting a delegation of representatives from the Korean tech community. Our visitors were spending time in NYC and Silicon Valley through an accelerator program sponsored by Google, and included representatives from these startups:</p>

  <header>
    
    <time>10 November 2014</time>
    
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p><span><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/4a9613f1cbcbe3cf9b64909308a19d30/tumblr_inline_netx5cI2Z81qbktb4.png"/></span></p>
<p><span>It’s no secret that China is an enormous market with significant potential for luxury retailers. It’s also </span><a href="http://www.internetretailer.com/commentary/2014/09/08/e-commerce-expansion-china-balancing-act-retailers" target="_blank">no secret that operating in China is a riskier and more complex</a><span> endeavor than operating in traditional western markets, which is why many retailers&ndash;including <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324102604578495120841524796" target="_blank">Nieman Marcus</a><span> and </span><a href="http://jingdaily.com/where-neiman-marcus-and-ebay-went-wrong-in-chinas-e-commerce-market/" target="_blank">eBay</a><span></span>&ndash;haven’t fully figured out how to truly compete there yet</span><span>. Taking a nuanced, intentional, and planned approach to entering China is essential. It is with such intentionality that Gilt approaches our recent relaunch into China.</span></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to announce today a significant set of new products and features for our Chinese customers in preparation for <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102163022" target="_blank">November 11th&ndash;otherwise known as Singles&rsquo; Day, or &ldquo;1111</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Success in China is highly dependent on relationships&ndash;关系, pronounced &ldquo;Guānxì&rdquo;&ndash;and, as such, our recent launch was done in close alignment with our friends at <a href="https://www.alipay.com" target="_blank"><span>Alipay</span></a>, <a href="http://www.alimama.com/" target="_blank"><span>Alimama</span></a>, and <a href="http://en.unionpay.com/" target="_blank"><span>UnionPay</span></a>. Our relationships have allowed us to make Gilt known and accessible to our Chinese customers in ways that <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/07/21/gilt-product-management-and-user-experience-guiding" target="_blank">surprise and delight</a> (as seen on our <a href="http://weibo.com/Gilt" target="_blank"><span>Gilt Weibo account</span></a>), and at a level that many other western retailers have yet to achieve. We’re thankful for and excited about these partnerships, and hope to build even more relationships as we further expand into China.</p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/3604f32e7f87ae61e185842f149bc54d/tumblr_inline_netwngbz8H1qbktb4.png"/></span></p>
<p>Our excitement and partnership is well encompassed in this quote <a href="http://jingdaily.com/gilt-goes-full-speed-ahead-in-chinas-e-commerce-market-with-alipay-partnership/?curator=Informerly" target="_blank">in Jing Daily</a> by Jingming Li, President of Alipay US:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“As China’s most widely used e-payment service provider, Alipay focuses on enabling commerce between global brands and Chinese consumers,” states Jingming Li, the president and chief architect of Alipay United States. “We are excited to partner with Gilt to help connect our consumers with the products and brands they desire. China’s e-commerce market could be worth as much as $650 billion in 2020,  and we see this as a great opportunity for global sites, like Gilt, that offer top-quality products and a premium shopping experience.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>How did we approach our China relaunch? And what should other companies keep in mind as they consider international expansion plans, and the nuances in those markets? In an attempt to answer these questions, I&rsquo;ll discuss a few key topics:</span></p>
<ol><li>Why China? Examining the market opportunity for Gilt</li>
<li>Gilt in China today</li>
<li>Optimizing for the Chinese customer experience</li>
<li>What’s next?</li>
</ol><h3>1. Why China? Examining the Market Opportunity for Gilt</h3>
<p><span>Evaluating the market opportunity is always an essential step in any major geographic expansion. Prior to making this investment for Gilt, we had to understand whether we could be positioned to succeed. Key questions we asked:</span></p>
<ul><li>
<p><span>How large is the luxury goods market in China? Is it growing?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>What are customer expectations in China? How do they differ from what we currently offer?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>What is Gilt’s current position in the market? What are competitors doing?</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>How must we alter Gilt&rsquo;s customer experience to best serve the Chinese audience?</span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Chinese Luxury Goods Market</strong><span><strong>:</strong> China&rsquo;s GDP is $8.3 trillion, and is growing at 7.4% per year. Ecommerce represents 5.5% of its total GDP. A portion of that is China&rsquo;s robust luxury goods market&ndash;estimated at </span><a href="http://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=chineselux2014" target="_blank"><span>nearly $102bn and growing</span></a><span>, and now the largest in the world (surpassing Japan). Chinese people also spent nearly </span><a href="http://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=chineselux2014" target="_blank"><span>$100 bn overseas, with 65% of that on shopping</span></a><span>. Finally, </span><a href="http://www.kpmg.com/CN/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/China-Connected-Consumers-201402-v2.pdf" target="_blank"><span>Chinese consumers prefer to shop online</span></a><span>, because online retail provides more assurances on product quality and origination than shopping in stores. Needless to say, China represents a significant and unique opportunity for a company like Gilt, which is especially positioned as an online purveyor of luxury goods otherwise difficult to obtain at our price points.</span></p>
<p><strong>Chinese Customers Want Access to Western Goods:</strong><span> Overseas consumption of luxury goods </span><a href="http://www.funggroup.com/eng/knowledge/research/china_dis_issue109.pdf" target="_blank"><span>accounted for nearly 60%</span></a><span> of total Chinese luxury spending in 2012. Even though the growth of China&rsquo;s total luxury market has slowed a bit, the pace of overseas consumption appears to be holding steady. Because of high customs and tariffs on import goods, local inventory and accessibility obstacles, and other market barriers, it’s difficult for Chinese customers to access luxury Western goods at Gilt&rsquo;s prices. This might partly explain </span><a href="http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/tsen_0.pdf" target="_blank"><span>why Chinese tourists are the world’s biggest spenders</span></a><span>&ndash;abroad, they can purchase items inaccessible in China.</span></p>
<p><strong>Singles&rsquo; Day, 11.11:</strong><span> One of the primary goals of our China relaunch was to create an optimized experience by November 11&ndash;known in China as Singles&rsquo; Day. Singles&rsquo; Day is the anti-Valentine’s Day: a celebration of singles in which people are encouraged to splurge on themselves. In 2013, </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/business/international/online-shopping-marathon-zooms-off-the-blocks-in-china.html?_r=0" target="_blank"><span>Singles&rsquo; Day drove nearly $6bn in sales</span></a><span> in China alone, on just one day. That’s 2.5x the sales on Cyber Monday in the U.S. With numbers like that, Gilt saw Singles&rsquo; Day 2014 as the perfect opportunity to drive excitement for our Chinese customers.</span></p>
<h3>2. Gilt in China Today</h3>
<p><span>Gilt has been serving customers in China since 2011, when we </span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/08/gilt-goes-global-expands-flash-sales-site-to-over-90-countries/" target="_blank"><span>opened our site to 100+ international countries</span></a><span>. At that time, our strategy was to partner with third-party providers who could assist us with our international strategy in an aggregate level. Over time, and as Gilt has grown substantially, it has become clear that, in order to provide the best customer experience to<em> all</em> of our users, we must be intentional in tailoring our user experience to the specific needs of our many markets. This requires a multi-pronged approach. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>Excluding Japan, International represented approximately 10% of Gilt&rsquo;s revenue in calendar 2013 versus 7% in 2012&ndash;and our global growth continues to accelerate. Combining our Japan business, total international revenue accounted for approximately 20% in calendar 2013. Asia continues to be a high-priority, high-growth region for Gilt, and you can bet that China is on top of that list.</span></p>
<h3>3. Optimizing for the Chinese Customer Experience</h3>
<p><span>In order for us to succeed in China, we had to understand the needs of our Chinese customers and how to build a platform and experience that resonated with their preferences. We sought to understand, evolve and build for:</span></p>
<ul><li><span>Chinese shopping expectations</span></li>
<li><span>language localization</span></li>
<li><span>local payment options</span></li>
<li><span>a mobile-focused approach</span></li>
<li><span>heavy social channel investment</span></li>
<li><span>improved shipping, logistics and returns</span></li>
<li><span>page load and latency</span></li>
<li><span>FAQs and localized customer service</span></li>
</ul><p><strong>Chinese Shopping Expectations Are Different</strong><span>. Customer service, engagement and user expectations in China differ from what western market consumers typically see and have come to expect. With different expectations come different user experience requirements. All of this translates into building products and features that make our shopping experience comfortable, trustworthy and delightful for Chinese users.<br/></span></p>
<p><em>A) The Chinese online shopper behaves differently</em><span>. As discussed in </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/3-traits-of-chinese-online-shoppers-2013-5" target="_blank">this Business Insider article</a><span>, Chinese shoppers shop differently from westerners. In China, a good shopping experience might include pop-up windows, infinite scrolls, and substantially more information than what westerners are used to seeing. </span></p>
<p><span>Gilt made a number of technical and operational changes to improve our experience for Chinese users. We also took into consideration these UX differences:  <br/></span></p>
<ul><li><span>Chinese (and other Asian) ecommerce sites tend to be denser than western sites, with more information/copy</span></li>
<li><span>Infinite scroll is used much more frequently</span></li>
<li><span>Menu sidebar navigation is used quite often</span></li>
<li><span>When clicking on a product, Chinese shoppers prefer to see new product windows or tabs open, rather than view the product in the same page <br/></span></li>
<li><span>Substantially more images and product information are expected in order to help users make their purchase decisions</span></li>
</ul><p><em>B) Quality and authenticity of goods and products</em><span>. Because </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/11/technology/alibaba-counterfeit-ipo/" target="_blank">counterfeit and fraudulent goods</a><span> plague the Chinese market, many Chinese shoppers don&rsquo;t trust unrecognized and unverified sites. Being able to establish guarantees of authenticity and having a reputation for offering quality goods is essential. This is one of the major reasons that Chinese users seek out known, reputable Western sites such as Gilt.</span></p>
<p><strong>Language Localization</strong><span>. Making it possible to browse Gilt&rsquo;s website, mobile apps and emails in Chinese was one of our first product roadmap items for our relaunch. Generally speaking, we know that we can’t just focus on English-speaking/reading international users in order to <span>achieve our target growth internationally</span>. While localization is key, however, we need to maintain <em>some</em> English on the site in order to assure Chinese shoppers that they&rsquo;re shopping on a secure, international website. Balance, rather than total localization, is our goal.<span> <br/></span></span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" height="207px;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/oBWD__TY-rF1zwleEvUjgHlOyZ3jiSa43VcjAhDl0FWua7BxiyaHmNcAqcrxRql81o0I-cnvzRk9qRNhN34LFF0MwjyqBWXLMkUfNNotT8eKpbfi-lL87doyzSIsEfguGQ" width="624px;"/></span></p>
<p>Our technology team&rsquo;s localization efforts for China included developing:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><span>a custom-built, flexible language localization platform that targets static site content</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>an easy language localization admin for instantaneous translations</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>a translation workflow for new content and new feature launches</span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Payment Options</strong><span>. Before our relaunch, Gilt only offered payment options with major U.S. credit cards and PayPal. Just 15% of Chinese consumers have U.S. credit cards, and PayPal isn&rsquo;t widely used, so only a small percentage of Chinese customers could actually buy products from Gilt. To remedy this issue, we began working with Alipay and UnionPay, who represent roughly 75% of the online payments market in China.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" height="284px;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FR86nR1DbRVYbaIc5jIrA_Baj7km4XCEiQjgxk9AFCfIVBDP2Xko_0W_ZttF74FyCBlS6SqWUks0KnQ3d-ktwT4Z4bmyxjvjm9F67Ob6U5RanVdFN9gzA6kggbwqHaJfpg" width="460px;"/></span></p>
<p><span><span> </span></span>For payment options and processing in China, we:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><span>integrated the Alipay payment platform </span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>integrated the UnionPay payment option</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>localized payment and checkout user flow for Alipay and UnionPay</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>optimized for these payment options to only be available for our Chinese customers</span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><span>We’re excited about these partnerships and are happy to see </span><a href="http://jingdaily.com/gilt-goes-full-speed-ahead-in-chinas-e-commerce-market-with-alipay-partnership/?curator=Informerly" target="_blank"><span>that the Chinese press has taken notice.</span></a><span> <span></span><a href="http://www.weibo.com/1627897870/BuHlm5nbN?type=comment#_rnd1415209239003" target="_blank"><span>Alipay</span></a> also shared the news <a href="http://www.weibo.com/1627897870/BuHlm5nbN?type=comment#_rnd1415209239003" target="_blank"><span>on Weibo</span></a>. Stateside, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MarthaStewart/status/522175235362414593" target="_blank"><span>our good friend Martha Stewart leaked the news</span></a><span> on Twitter a few weeks ago:</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden">
<p>Tracy Weber of Gilt Groupe is launching product on Alipay next week in time for 11-11 <a href="http://t.co/fHvNdq2M04" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/fHvNdq2M04</a></p>

<p>
<script charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" type="text/javascript"></script></p>
<p><strong>Mobile is essential</strong><span>. Google recently claimed that </span><a href="http://googleasiapacific.blogspot.com/2014/10/asias-mobile-first-world.html" target="_blank"><span>Asia was truly the world’s first “mobile-first” region</span></a><span>. At Gilt, our experience confirms this notion: Our mobile penetration rates in Asia are substantially higher than our U.S. rate. In China, mobile is quickly becoming the primary and dominant method for online shopping. Additionally, Chinese shoppers are much more accustomed to purchasing and buying goods online than are Western shoppers. To that end, approaching and building for the Chinese customer without considering mobile would be a huge mistake.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/77ffee11b20810606d14f025e0a64084/tumblr_inline_netxovyLud1qbktb4.png"/></span></p>
<p><span></span>Gilt executed a number of key mobile-related projects for our China relaunch, including:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><span>the launch of our iOS app in Chinese</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>the launch of our Android app in Chinese</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>localization of our Responsive Mobile Web experience in Chinese</span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Social engagement is mandatory</strong><span>. Given the quality and authenticity issues discussed above, savvy Chinese shoppers have forged a lively information-sharing community on social media networks such as </span><a href="http://weibo.com/Gilt" target="_blank"><span>Weibo</span></a><span> and </span><a href="http://www.wechat.com/en/" target="_blank"><span>WeChat</span></a><span>. In turn, companies need to establish a presence on these networks to establish their reputations, reinforce their legitimacy and remain transparent with Chinese users who wish comment and discuss their shopping experiences online. </span></p>
<p><span>Gilt prepared for our soft launch in China by launching our company Weibo and WeChat accounts two weeks ago. We found that users were sharing our fully translated FAQ site, and also commenting how delighted they were about our localized content.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" height="315px;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/C19lPOYEhSp5kJxlg38CW7R5XTyOGOepXTbd_aXWgMIu4_tqOc_5MQjZs2m2NpbjVtlRkrJ8ZvK0ZiOMrseV8UUgbJ5_auv4sDuJlDUHHC2E0_Vce7IEtIrY3X0BGQ3zpw" width="447px;"/></span></p>
<p>To continue building our social presence in China, Gilt is:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>growing and managing our <a href="http://weibo.com/Gilt" target="_blank">Gilt Weibo account</a>, which is verified as authentic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>growing and managing a Gilt WeChat account, also verifie<br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>using all of our Chinese social media accounts as avenues for customer service and user interaction. </span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><span>This </span><a href="http://weibo.com/1219577152/BvcRRAQAw?type=comment#_rnd1415374414405" target="_blank"><span>Weibo user enjoyed </span></a><span>our customer service and, through this public discourse, has enhanced our new and growing reputation:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I sent a message to the @gilt account, just to give it a try. I didn&rsquo;t expect a reply, but I received one. Gilt refunded my shipping cost, and now I&rsquo;m happily waiting for my package to arrive. I feel I will come back to Gilt more&ndash;it sells some nice stuff. “ (Translated from the original Chinese text)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span><span></span></span><strong>Elevated shipping and return experiences</strong><span>. China is the leading </span><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/06/01/jingdong-china-same-day-delivery/" target="_blank"><span>market for three-hour shipping</span></a><span>, the implications of which could be substantial. In the U.S., our expectations for timely delivery have been shaped by Amazon Prime and two-day shipping, but we’re nowhere close to same-day shipping yet. New logistics companies and startups in China are rapidly changing their customers&rsquo; delivery-related expectations, and Western companies may have to catch up and integrate with capable partners in order to meet similar expectations.</span></p>
<p><span>Given the complex system for handling customs, duties and taxes, Gilt did some research and learned that our Chinese users overwhelmingly prefer to have </span><a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delivereddutyunpaid.asp" target="_blank"><span>DDU (Deliver Duties Unpaid) </span></a><span>in their international transactions. W</span>e also sought out the best international logistics partners possible, and are excited to enable a number of key capabilities for our Chinese customers. These include:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><span>direct to China international shipping at $9.95 on orders above $100</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>international returns</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>localized-shipping customer service</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>enabling DDU as the primary option for handling customs and tax</span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><span><span>We still have much work to do in making sure that our customer experience in this area is as amazing as we want it to be, but are on our way.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Page load and latency</strong><span>. Anyone operating websites and applications for international users knows that page-load times and latency can be huge issues if you don’t have a local server or CDN to help speed things up for users. In order to have localized Chinese hosts and server support (including CDNs), </span><a href="http://blog.sinohosting.net/icp-license-in-china-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank"><span>your company needs an ICP that&rsquo;s licensed and authorized by the Chinese government</span></a><span>. We weren’t able to finalize our ICP licensing process in time for our relaunch, so we&rsquo;ve had to be creative. </span>In order to reduce page latency for Chinese users, our engineering teams:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><span>optimized the process for loading fonts and images on our site</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>simplified the graphical, interaction design and UX<br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>selectively reduced the number of JavaScript calls made to external sources</span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><span>As a result of these efforts, on some areas in our site, </span><strong>we’ve seen nearly a 50% reduction in page load times, averaging between 20% to 40% improvements across our applications</strong><span>. This is only a first step: Our teams will continue working to deliver the fastest, best possible experience possible. Ultimately, our goal is to get our own local ICP up and running so that we can deliver our best intended UX for Chinese customers.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" height="403px;" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wPbZ5fLGlXSmljgpKQaV7A5ZKP35-0ajjc505fmVyxrE33oIWmHjbP3QrImCC8hiTL5eAyVpRJXVYUovtcJQZlAifuDZUw-UAViTKdJUgs2luPmuv7I6TV11v9ds0uYrYQ" width="624px;"/></span></p>
<p><span><span> </span><strong>FAQs and customer service</strong>. </span><span>Given the complexity of international shipping, transactions and purchases, having a buttoned-up and </span><a href="http://www.gilt.com/support/global" target="_blank"><span>localized International FAQ</span></a><span> is absolutely essential. Additionally, ensuring that our Customer Service team can serve <em>all</em> of our customers&rsquo; needs in any and every language is one of our primary goals. Our international customers overwhelmingly prefer to interact with Customer Service via chat instead of phone or email, so our online chat function has been core to our Customer Service strategy.</span> </p>
<p><span>To reduce friction and allay any fears our Chinese users may have about completing their purchases on Gilt, </span>Gilt executed a number of key projects:</p>
<ul><li>
<p><span>designed a China-specific FAQ experience</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>localized the China-specific FAQ in Simplified Chinese</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>hired and trained Chinese-speaking customer service reps<br/></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>launched and grew our online chat capabilities with </span><a href="http://www.liveperson.com/" target="_blank"><span>LivePerson</span></a><span></span></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>4. What’s Next</h3>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-1c1eccf6-9a25-7197-ffcc-c1b0257b02b5"><span>When we started working on our China relaunch five months ago, we didn’t fully appreciate how much this experience would bring together the multitude of teams across Gilt&ndash;from technology to merchandising and marketing and beyond. One of the main reasons I love working at Gilt is that I get to collaborate with so many amazing people&ndash;especially our engineers. Working on this project has strengthened that love. </span></span><span><span>The massive amount of product management that this project required, and the effort and passion that everyone exhibited, may be unmatched in Gilt recent history and as such, I&rsquo;m deeply in awe of what we&rsquo;ve all achieved together. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We recognize that this is only the first step of many in making our experience better for our Chinese customers, and we’re excited to continue to grow and evolve with our customers as we learn more from them. We’re excited to apply these learnings as we continue to expand our business in Korea, Russia and other strategic countries. We’re super-passionate about ensuring that Gilt customers around the world are surprised and delighted with their experience with us, every single day.</span></span></p>

  <header>
    
    <time>07 November 2014</time>
    
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>At <a href="http://gilt.com/" target="_blank">Gilt</a>, we are obsessed with our site&rsquo;s performance. We use a variety of tools and design patterns to make sure our user experience is as fast as possible. In addition, our Web Performance team&ndash;Senior Software Engineer Eric Shepherd and me (Gregory Mazurek, Lead Software Engineer)&ndash;is committed to creating internal tools that can help our engineers, designers, and product people create great experiences for our users.</p>
<p>Today we launched an open-source Google Chrome Extension to help everyone see a site&rsquo;s performance in a non-invasive and clear way. It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-performance-timing-ap/nllipdabkglnhmanndddgcihbcmjpfej?hl=en-US&amp;authuser=1" target="_blank">Web Performance API Timing</a> and is available for download for free. In addition, the code that drives the extension is available on <a href="https://github.com/GregM/performance-timing-google-chrome-extension" target="_blank">my GitHub page</a>.</p>
<p>The extension takes advantage of the browser&rsquo;s native Performance Timing API to show the event&rsquo;s respective time and the percentage of the total load time. When you hover over each event, you will see how this timing was calculated.</p>
<p>We hope it&rsquo;s a useful tool for you as you become more and more obsessed with your website&rsquo;s or someone else site&rsquo;s performance. Please let us know what you think!</p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-ed86e9ad-8bf0-d5d2-f078-5723c82669c2"><span>Team Scalasaurus&ndash;five members of the Gilt Tech team&ndash;won first place at the </span><em>New York Times</em><span>’s first-ever <a href="http://developers.nytimes.com/events/" target="_blank">TimesOpen Team Trivia Night</a>: a tech-themed battle-of-the-developer-minds that took place Wednesday evening at <em>Times </em>HQ. HUZZAH! </span></p>
<p><span>Team Scalasaurus included <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/michael+reed" target="_blank">Michael Reed</a> (Senior Software Engineer, Back Office), <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/jim+englert" target="_blank">Jim Englert</a> (Lead Software Engineer, Push/Email), <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/kyle+dorman" target="_blank">Kyle Dorman</a> (Software Engineer, Special Operations), <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/kevin+li" target="_blank">Kevin Li</a> (Software Engineer, Loyalty), and me, software engineering intern Helena Wu (Global). We played </span><span>against ~12 teams</span><span> from other companies, including ZocDoc and Kaggle</span><span>.</span><span> Trivia categories included tech history, emoji programming, and current events. Each trivia round consisted of 10 questions. </span></p>
<p><span>We didn’t score a lot of points in the tech history category, but we aced the emoji round and drew upon our individual expertise to score in the other categories. Kevin showed his knowledge in obscure, profane programming languages; Kyle knew about the ex-mayor of Boston’s years in office; Jim demonstrated his extensive Java knowledge by listing all of its reserved keys; Michael knew about Sotheby’s latest auction, and I knew about the cuisine at the Noma restaurant in Copenhagen. </span></p>
<p><span>After the rounds came the bonus question: Name three of the exercises in the </span><em>Times</em><span>’ <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/" target="_blank">seven-minute workout</a>. We took our best shot, using Jim and Kyle’s fitness expertise as our guide. “YOLO,” we said as we handed in our answers.</span></p>
<p><span>After the bonus round, the judges quickly computed the points. When they announced the third- and second-place winners and their scores, we started to feel a bit sad. Then the announcer said (paraphrasing here): “And the champions of TimesOpen trivia is… errmm… the name starts with a S…” All of us stopped and thought: “Wait… what?!” And we heard: “Scalasaurus!!!” We were all very surprised and happy! We felt a sense of accomplishment and pride to have achieved VICTORY for Gilt Tech!</span></p>
<p><span>In my few months as an engineering intern, I have worked on many exciting projects and have learned so much. My opportunity to participate in TimesOpen Trivia Night is just another example of how Gilt Tech is a friendly, diverse and fun environment for every member of the team.</span></p>

    <p><strong><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/d3802fce01d16d49397cb8af2f8cba03/tumblr_inline_nel32dlrcX1s17bu5.jpg"/></strong></p>

<p>Recently <a href="http://www.gilt.com/" target="_blank">Gilt</a> collaborated with Hewlett-Packard and fashion designer Michael Bastian on the MB Chronowing: a super-stylish, <strong>limited-edition smartwatch </strong>(see above) that<strong> <a href="http://www.gilt.com/sale/men/mm/michael-bastian-x-hewlettpackard-1" target="_blank">you can buy <em>exclusively</em> on Gilt starting November 7</a></strong>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=250770" target="_blank">Sridhar Solur</a> is the Director, Next Gen Computing&ndash;Incubation and Innovation at HP, and the man behind the engineering of this amazing new timepiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t consider myself a guru on wearables, but <a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/michael-bastian-creates-a-smartwatch-that-looks-like-a-watch-1414776232" target="_blank">collaborating with Gilt and Michael Bastian to create this smartwatch</a> has taught me quite a bit about them,&rdquo; he says. When it comes to describing himself, Sridhar&rsquo;s apparently a lot like his latest wearable creation &ndash; i.e., classy and understated. So we&rsquo;ll highlight some of his many accomplishments for you: In addition to founding of HP&rsquo;s Wearables business, he is widely recognized as an expert on cloud computing, product management and mobile devices. One of the cross-platform apps he&rsquo;s developed has been downloaded +40 million times.</p>
<p>Sridhar has generously shared with us&ndash;and you&ndash;his list of the top five things to keep in mind when building wearable tech:</p>
<ol><li>Remember: Fashion is what you wear, and electronics are what you carry. So either make it gorgeous or make it invisible.</li>
<li>Resist the temptation to duplicate the old UI rules of mobile into a wearable.</li>
<li>Use familiar shapes and socially acceptable practices. (For example, screaming commands into a watch may be a tad uncomfortable for many people!)</li>
<li>Trying to sell your wearable as jewelry is not easy. Remember: Jewelry is timeless, and technology is ephemeral.</li>
<li>And finally: less is more. We are already slaves to our phones and live in a hyper-notified world. Wearables/IOT technologies should amplify our ability to absorb information and make it possible for more things to be done <em>for us</em>, not done <em>by us</em>. The less often the wearer has to engage with your smartwatch, the better. The last thing you want is people looking at their smartwatches and driving!</li>
</ol><p>Here&rsquo;s a pic of (L-R) Sridhar, Michael Bastian and Gilt Chief Merchandising Officer Keith George at last night's MB Chronowing event at the Ludlow Hotel:</p>
