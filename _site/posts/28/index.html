    <p id="docs-internal-guid-220cc7bf-fffd-5e28-cc23-2a0562e53c26"><span>Earlier this week Gilt’s women technologists had a sit-down with </span><a href="https://twitter.com/shanlynm" target="_blank"><span>Shan-Lyn Ma</span></a><span>, co-founder and CEO of the new wedding registry company Zola.com. Formerly of Gilt&ndash;as a product manager and then general manager, she helped launch several Gilt products, including our iPhone and iPad apps&ndash;Shan met with Gilt’s women technologists for some cupcakes, fancy bubblies, and an inspiring conversation about her experiences as an entrepreneur. </span></p>
<p><span>Gilt’s tech women had so many questions for Shan that at times it felt like a rapid-fire round! Many of us were curious about how she manages challenges in her current role compared to when she was at Gilt. And some of us asked for her secret to successfully driving new ideas forward in a male-dominated industry like tech. Her response: persuade, persuade, and persuade some more, without giving up&ndash;and make your points data-based. Zola co-founder and CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/flungster" target="_blank">Felix Lung</a> (another Gilt alum), who came along with Shan, listened to the discussion. Thanks to both Zola leaders for their candor and insightful comments!</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/07/02/ceo-michelle-peluso-lunches-with-gilts-women" target="_blank">Informal discussions with powerful tech women</a> are just a few of the events organized by our informal Gilt tech women’s group, founded almost two years ago. We sure know how to beat the Monday afternoon blues, don’t we? </span></p>

  <header>

    <p><span><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/ff140070177d600e08bec313384d9ac1/tumblr_inline_n31wt64AfW1s17bu5.jpg"/></span></p>
<p><em>svc-inventory-request helps us handle our modelling photography</em></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-eadc03b0-ff1b-02ce-4534-0912f86e6568"><span>Hi, everyone! This is the start of a (hopefully) regular series in which we take a closer look at Gilt <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/micro-services" target="_blank">micro-services</a>: the hundreds of services that together make up our distributed, Scala-built micro-services architecture. For each installment, I’ll pull a random repo from Gerrit and interview a Gilt technologist about the relevant micro-service. Together we’ll learn more about what micro-services are and what they do, and uncover some of the funny and interesting histories behind some of the code we’ve written over the years.</span></p>
<p><span>First up for review is </span><strong>svc-inventory-request:</strong><span> an inventory-related microservice created by Gilt Software Engineer, Back Office team member and <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/02/07/fancy-cheese-friday" target="_blank">fancy-cheese</a> aficionado Robert Brazier. Let’s get right to it!</span></p>
<p><strong>What is svc-inventory-request, and what does it do?<br/></strong><span>svc-inventory-request handles lists of fashion modeling shots and other miscellaneous pull requests for inventory. In part, it acts as a proxy to a second, distribution-oriented micro-service related to internal inventory transfers. “It seems to do so little, but there’s so much code for it,” Rob told us (with a sigh).</span></p>
<p><strong>When was it born?<br/></strong>T<span>he primary work began in May 2012 and lasted through that summer. It was the first Scala project that Rob worked on!</span></p>
<p><strong>Any funny or interesting facts, cool power programmer moves or stupid code tricks?<br/></strong><span>svc-inventory-request was one of the first times Rob crossed paths with Scala’s 22-parameter limit on case classes. While writing it, he discovered a Scala language bug! He submitted it to <a href="http://typesafe.com/" target="_blank">Typesafe</a> and recently learned that it was fixed in <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/news/2013/10/01/release-notes-v2.10.3.html" target="_blank">2.10.3</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Back in 2012, the Gilt Back Office team was still in Rails mode, and everyone knew about (and loved?) ActiveRecord. Rob asked around to see if a similar tool existed for Scala, but everyone warned him away from the ORM options available to him at the time. Rob wrote his own mini-ORM into svc-inventory-request! Similarly, there was still a lot of contention around how to handle JSON serialization/deserialization. Rob wrote that as well.  ”So much terrible,” Rob recalls. If he were to do it all over again, he’d use <a href="http://slick.typesafe.com/" target="_blank">Slick</a>: “It looks really nice for the database stuff.” </span></p>
<p><strong>What’s svc-inventory-request up to these days?<br/></strong><span>Rob says it’s mostly in maintenance mode. The Back Office team is working on several new micro-services that will subsume a lot of svc-inventory-request’s workflow. Our PR team and other non-tech departments still use the micro-service fairly regularly, though.</span></p>
<p><strong>Any last words?<br/></strong><span>Rob: “Don’t write your own ORM.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Stats:</strong></p>
<ul><li><span>First committer: Rob Brazier</span></li>
<li><span>Top committers: Rob Brazier, Kevin Hyland, Anthony Manfredi</span></li>
<li><span>Number of commits (as of March 2014): 196</span></li>
</ul><p><span>That’s it for now! See you next time, when we take a look at <strong>lib-googledrive</strong>.<br/></span></p>

<p>Last month we told you about the Gilt <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/02/27/plasma-prix-preview" target="_blank">Plasma Prix</a>: a race pitting our ten fastest <a href="http://plasmacar.com/" target="_blank">PlasmaCar</a> racers from NYC and Dublin against each other in a bid for glory, fame, and modestly sized trophies. Here&rsquo;s the official epic documentary! Thanks to videographer <a href="http://christiclifford.com/" target="_blank">Christi Clifford</a> for capturing all the thrills and excitement of the event.</p>

<p>We also created a Plasma Prix photo set: just <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gilttech/sets/72157641726013884/" target="_blank">go here</a> to look.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2014/03/25/gilt-japans-gilt-city-app-goes-fully-responsive">Gilt Japan's Gilt City App Goes Fully Responsive</a></h1>
  
  <header>
    
    <time>25 March 2014</time>
    
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The Gilt Japan team just launched a brand-new, fully responsive Gilt City website. Some screenshots: </p>
<p><strong>New Ticket Vouchers on Mobile!</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/53f3f1371cda7dd1b795e00b2882b64f/tumblr_inline_n2zzp50Gpj1s17bu5.png"/></p>
<p><strong>A brand-new sale page for desktop:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Brand-new account pages with Stores and City orders split up:</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/d55ad7c4cfd8ed80dbdb520344a6f246/tumblr_inline_n2zzuxtjf51s17bu5.png"/></strong></p>

<p><strong><strong>More about what&rsquo;s new:<br/></strong></strong>One of our main goals was to improve the readability and usability of the browsing experience. We&rsquo;ve made significant changes to simplify the way we structure and deliver information to our users, optimized across all devices. We have also revamped the ticket code voucher, social sharing, and invitation functionality. Take a look at our brand new Account pages, which now support both Gilt Stores and City purchase history, returns and wait lists!</p>
<p><strong>Responsive?<br/></strong><span>Up until now we&rsquo;ve been managing our mobile and desktop sites separately. With our new responsive architecture, however, a single URL now serves the same great user experience, optimized on each of the customer&rsquo;s devices. We can also execute marketing activities across all of users in a consistent fashion. All of this amounts to centralized tracking, which we can leverage to gain deeper insights into user behavior and better inform the decisions we make.  </span></p>
<p><strong>Next Steps<br/></strong><span>Going responsive with City marks the jump-off point for our bigger product development roadmap. Our newly built technical foundations and core components (login, registration, invitations, checkout, accounts, etc.) are entirely modular and reusable for the Stores business. This puts us in a strong position to deliver with great speed and confidence a brand new responsive Stores website and iOS app in the upcoming months. </span><span>Please keep an eye out for updates on this front!</span></p>

<p>A few weeks ago the Gilt technology team learned via Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/matlockx" target="_blank">Martin</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/adrianco" target="_blank">Adrian Cockcroft</a> featured Gilt&rsquo;s <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/micro-services" target="_blank">micro-services architecture</a> in his <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/03/06/gilts-micro-services-architecture-gets-a-mention-at" target="_blank">presentation</a> at QCon London. Adrian is the former Chief Architect for High Performance Technical Computing at Sun Microsystems (and author of the best-selling <em>Sun Performance and Tuning </em>book), founding member of eBay Research Labs, former Cloud Architect at Netflix (he helped lead Netflix’s migration to a large scale, highly available public-cloud architecture and the open sourcing of the cloud-native NetflixOSS platform), and current Technology Fellow at Battery Ventures. Adrian was in New York City today and stopped by our office for lunch and a chat with some of our engineers. On the menu: falafel and kebabs from <a href="http://www.alibabaturkishcuisine.com/" target="_blank">Ali Baba</a>:</p>

<p>We had a fantastic time listening to Adrian talk about his experiences and current work. Thanks to him for taking time out of his busy schedule to visit!</p>

  <h1><a href="/2014/03/20/use-etcd-as-a-filesystem-with-etcd-fs">Use ETCD as a Filesystem With ETCD-FS!</a></h1>
  
  <header>
    
    <time>20 March 2014</time>
    
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Gilt Principal Systems Engineer <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/search/jonathan+leibiusky" target="_blank">Jonathan Leibiusky</a> is a fan of <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd" target="_blank">ETCD</a><span data-name="coreos">: CoreOS</span>&rsquo;s extremely powerful, highly-available key value store for shared configuration and service discovery, inspired by Apache ZooKeeper* and written in Go. Jon thought it would be great if ETCD could also be used as a filesystem. Companies that have already deployed apps that read a configuration file from a local filesystem might want to load these config files to something like ETCD and ensure a consistent view across a cluster of nodes. Given that the Filesystem API is super-stable, widely known and supported, and simple, using ETCD in this manner would make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Jon has created <a href="https://github.com/xetorthio/etcd-fs" target="_blank">ETCD-FS</a>, which allows you to mount ETCD as a FUSE filesystem. In other words, every existing application can basically start using ETCD as regular files and directories without lots of effort. Implemented in Go, ETCD-FS uses Han-Wen Nienhuys&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse" target="_blank">go-fuse</a> module and CoreOS&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/coreos/go-etcd" target="_blank">go-etcd</a> module and works like this:</p>
<ul><li>Every file maps to a key in ETCD</li>
<li>Every directory maps to a directory in ETCD</li>
<li>The content of every file maps to the value of the key in ETCD</li>
</ul><p><strong>How to Install ETCD-FS:</strong></p>
<p>Clone the project and build it:</p>
<div>
<pre>make build
</pre>
</div>
<p>This generates an executable file <code>etcdfs</code>. You can mount ETCD as a filesystem by running <code>etcdfs MOUNT_PATH ETCD_ENDPOINT</code>. For example:</p>
<div>
<pre>./etcds /tmp/foobar http://localhost:4001
</pre>
</div>
<p>Then you can access <code>/tmp/foobar</code> and use etcd as a filesystem.</p>
<p>To unmount it:</p>
<div>
<pre>fusermount -u /tmp/foobar<br/><br/></pre>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What ETCD-FS Supports:</strong></p>
<p>Basic filesystem operations, such as:</p>
<ul><li>Reading/Writing files</li>
<li>Creating/Deleting files</li>
<li>Creating/Deleting directories</li>
</ul><p><strong>What&rsquo;s Next for ETCD-FS</strong></p>
<p>Jon would like to enable users to mount a filesystem to a specific ETCD node (not necessarily or always the root). Less than a week old, ETCD-FS is a work in progress&ndash;but Jon <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/03/19/jons-latest-open-source-project-go-supertest-http" target="_blank">creates quickly</a>, so expect this project to become more and more exciting in short order!</p>
<p><em>* ETCD differs from ZooKeeper in that it&rsquo;s based on the <a href="http://raftconsensus.github.io/" target="_blank">Raft Consensus Algorithm</a>; ZooKeeper has its own consensus algorithm, called <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ZOOKEEPER/Zab+vs.+Paxos" target="_blank">Zab</a>.)</em></p>

<p>On Tuesday night Gilt hosted the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYCMAD/" target="_blank">New York Mobile App Developer</a> meetup&rsquo;s March event: a technical talk delivered by our very own Principal Software Engineer, <strong>Adam Kaplan</strong>! More than 100 engineers from Twitter, Getty Images, Bloomberg, the <em>New York Times</em>and other companies joined us for Adam&rsquo;s talk, which highlighted the ways we&rsquo;ve been using Akka to scale our massive push notification system. How massive? <em>Three-million-messages-in-less-than-60-seconds massive!</em></p>
<p>In his presentation, Adam described his team&rsquo;s work building a distributed <span class="full">architecture built with Scala, Akka, ZooKeeper, and other technologies. He explained how Akka&rsquo;s clustering capabilities not only make mass messaging possible, but also promote overall system integrity, scalability, and better performance (and, on the business side of things, higher revenues!). He also placed push notifications in the context of Gilt&rsquo;s general engineering culture, which emphasizes a micro-services architecture, fault tolerance, and (the good kind of) redundancy.  </span></p>
<p><span class="full">Some highlights from the meetup:</span></p>

<p><em>Many guests stayed long after Adam&rsquo;s talk and Q&amp;A to ask questions, grab another drink and mingle with Gilt technologists and other attendees. </em></p>
<p>Thanks to NYMAD and all of our guests for a great night! Our next tech event will be a panel on Docker on April 29; more details to come!</p>

  <header>

  <div class="content">
    <p><img alt="image" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/eb1580d361dc58e0e0cfaff54c8186ee/tumblr_inline_n2mzlvJH5y1s17bu5.jpg"/></p>
<p><strong>How did you get to Gilt?<br/></strong><span>In late 2011, I was working as a contractor at another eCommerce company, and Gilt was at the end-stage of opening its Dublin office. A Gilt recruiter contacted me, and a few months later&ndash;in May 2012&ndash;I started here. </span></p>
<p><strong>What were you hired on to do?<br/></strong><span>At first I was hired on to be a performance engineer, then I almost immediately switched to infrastructure engineering. </span></p>
<p><strong>Did you have a background in infrastructure engineering?<br/></strong><span>Not specifically. For much of my career I’ve worked at startups as a full-stack engineer. I’ve also founded a couple of startups, and worked in senior roles. In a startup, you end up learning a lot about how to write software and sell it, but you often don’t learn how to scale it in an organization. This is the first time in my career other than my last job where I’ve seen companies out of their startup phase. </span></p>
<p><strong>When you got to Gilt, what did you do first?<br/></strong><span>Soon after I started we came up with a project, Galactica, and I began working on implementing parts of the idea. Gilt being Gilt, I kind of found work that I wanted to do, that wasn’t what I was originally hired to do. </span></p>
<p><span>The scale of Gilt is nice: it’s small enough that you can get your head around its infrastructure, but large enough to be impressive</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tell us more about what Galactica is and does.<br/></strong><span>Galactica is a family of services that allocates containers via Docker, allows for provisioning of other services, and implements a meta-data model. It echoes the immutability of Scala, the language we use at Gilt. Immutability is important to us&ndash;it enables engineers to do things concurrently and safely, and enables you to avoid situations in which two things try to change your data at the same time. </span></p>
<p><span>When complete, Galactica will give us the confidence to deploy quickly and often, and if we do break something, we can recover quickly by switching back to the previous version. The previous will still be running, it just won’t be taking any traffic. For now we’re working on or staging, integration and pre-production environments, but will eventually tackle our full production environment in the same way.</span></p>
<p><strong>What do you think of Docker?<br/></strong><span>Docker is lighter weight than any other comparable technology out there, it’s open source, and it’s much easier to experiment with. It’s not a system for providing computing resources as a service, per se&ndash;it really just does one thing, which is to start processes inside containers. Docker lets us to build our own services around it. </span></p>
<p><strong>How long have you been working in Scala?<br/></strong><span>I started using it not long before I started working at Gilt. During the hiring process, I was asked to write an implementation of an interview question that I’d described during my initial interview&ndash;I wrote it in Scala. It wasn’t great Scala, but it was definitely a good thing to have done (it got me the job!).</span></p>
<p><strong>How has Scala made you a happier engineer?<br/></strong><span>Well, before I made the switch I was working in Java and programming functionally in Guava. This was extremely frustrating: I was typing ten times as many characters as I felt was really necessary. Scala was a huge relief: it’s got a steep learning curve, but once you achieve a point of proficiency it’s great. For a learning tool I recommend Typesafe’s courses on Coursera&ndash;some of us took the courses, and it actually changed elements of our style because we saw (Scala creator Martin) Odersky doing certain things, and it gave us permission to do them as well (the content is also extremely good).</span></p>
<p><strong>Can you name one of the ways Typesafe’s courses altered your style?<br/></strong><span>One little thing was using if and else more often. There’s a tendency in Scala to overuse some of its monadic features. Quite often, if you take a slight step backwards and take advantage of its functional programming features, you can produce code that is safe and functional, but also looks better.</span></p>
<p><strong>You’ve actually taught some Scala&ndash;talk about that.<br/></strong><span>Last fall I <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/07/30/interested-in-free-scala-training-at-gilts-dublin" target="_blank">helped teach a Scala session</a> to some engineers in the Dublin community. I’ve also helped others on the team. I’ve always liked mentoring because it’s rewarding&ndash;it helps you to learn. When you’re teaching someone you find gaps in your own knowledge. Students ask the best questions! We’ve talked about creating an advanced-level Scala course&ndash;I’m going to help with the curriculum.</span></p>
<p><strong>Did you study programming in school?<br/></strong><span>Yes, I have a CS degree. I started programming when I was eight!</span></p>
<p><strong>Are you experimenting with any other languages at the moment?<br/></strong><span>One of the earliest things I did at Gilt was to write a Lisp interpreter. Lisp is something I come back to, because it’s extremely easy to write a Lisp interpreter; also, a fundamental understanding of it enables you to explore other languages quite well. Aside from that, I have checked out Go but haven’t gone deep into it. Clojure is definitely on the list of things I’d like to experiment with.</span></p>
<p><strong>How active are you in the open source community?<br/></strong><span>I’m a contributor to <a href="https://github.com/gilt/gatling-websocket" target="_blank">Gatling</a>, a tool for load testing. It generates requests to send to a web service or application at a very high volume. It also measures how long those requests take, and how your application performs under different levels of load. Last year I gave a talk at the Scala.io conference in Paris with one of Gatling’s founders&ndash;we discussed load testing and using Gatling at Gilt.</span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><strong>How are we using Gatling, exactly?<br/></strong><span>At Gilt, we’ve found that writing tests in code is much more effective in encouraging people to write tests, period. We don’t have a team of performance engineers writing tests, but a team that writes tooling. We want developers to write tests, and have it become second nature. It’s harder when testing means using a GUI&ndash;you have to learn something new to write the test. The way Gatling works was very appealing to us, and the reports looked fantastic. We took it on, built some tooling so we can run tests against EC2, and now test the site three times a day. We receive alarms if there’s a failure, so we’re now working on a tool called the Smoking Gun Detector&ndash;it will run after every load test, analyze behavior as the log tests saw it, analyze the behavior of the requests the log test made, and identify or suggest</span><span> </span><span>backend services that are indirectly accessed as a result of the load test. The intention is that it will automatically identify anomalies. If a load test fails or performs slowly, the Smoking Gun Detector will hopefully point out where the source of the problem is. Eventually we’d hope to have it running all the time, comparing the performance of our services and identifying irregularities. </span></p>
<p><strong>How would you describe Gilt’s attitude toward open source?<br/></strong><span>Gilt is a great company for <a href="http://gilt.github.io/" target="_blank">open source</a>. Many companies restrict their engineers’ ability to contribute to projects or launch their own&ndash;even on their own time. Here, as long as you’re responsible for what you do, and you don’t do anything stupid, it’s acceptable. </span></p>
<p><span>It’s the same with other things about our culture&ndash;for example, contributing to the tech blog. It’s kind of rare that you have companies of our size that encourage everyone in tech to blog on the company’s site&ndash;usually, there are four or five people who blog, and they present a micromanaged view of how the company works. </span></p>
<p><strong>Final question: What are your goals?<br/></strong><span>I have three types of goals. One is project-based: I’d like to complete Galactica. Another relates to evangelism, both internal and external: teaching Scala, writing blog posts, etc. The final goal is DevOps-oriented&ndash;to continue to drive reliability. Because of the time difference, the Dublin team is up and awake long before the people in NYC arrive at work. Usually if something problematic happens overnight, the Dublin team is working on it. I would like to help us achieve a pure devops culture, where everyone is in ops and has full privileges. I’m trying to encourage that mindset across the organization&ndash;i.e., if you have an interest in how systems work, make sure you get privileges and join in on keeping them working. The way we build now, it’s hard to severely damage something&ndash;but if you do, just ask for forgiveness. </span></p>
