<p>We&rsquo;re excited to welcome the Full-Stack Engineering meetup <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/12/19/a-full-stack-and-a-full-house" target="_blank">back to Gilt</a> on Tuesday, Jan. 28! (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Full-Stack-Engineering-Meetup/events/152218942/" target="_blank">Go here</a> to RSVP.) The night&rsquo;s three speakers include HUGE Principal Architect <strong>Isaiah Belle</strong>, NBCUniversal Manager of Enterprise Architecture <strong>Sam Boyer</strong>, and open source advocate/hero <strong>Rocky Bernstein</strong>. The meetup starts at 6:30 PM at our 2 Park Avenue office and will include discussion of the PHP frameworks Symfony2 and Drupal. Oh, and we&rsquo;ll also have some delicious sandwiches!</p>
<p>Once described as someone who &quot;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/LispNYC/events/47373722/" target="_blank">lives in relative obscurity</a>,&ldquo; Rocky Bernstein is the creator of the Pydb extended Python debugger, the ruby-debug BASH debugger, and many other software tools used daily by millions. He was kind enough to take some time out of his schedule to answer a few questions:</p>
<p><strong>Gilt: In this age of social media, you seem to prefer flying under the radar to self-promoting. Why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rocky Bernstein:</strong> I&rsquo;d say that most of the folks who have used software that I&rsquo;ve written wouldn&rsquo;t recognize my somewhat unusual name. I have neither a Facebook nor a Twitter account. With social things, there is a quality/quantity trade-off. The few friends that I have are very important to me, and I would rather devote a lot of time and effort towards those, than less time and effort towards more people. With respect to the software, what&rsquo;s important to me is getting stuff done and problems solved.</p>
<p><strong>G: How do you come up with open source projects to tackle&ndash;what&rsquo;s your creative process?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> Invariably the projects find me, and not the other way around. Sometimes people come to me with a request for a feature or something, and I ask them to take a stab at the problem first. A common response is that they don&rsquo;t know anything about the field. Well, jumping in can be a good way to learn.</p>
<p>The decision to start the CD-reading project was unusual in that it was politically motivated. It came from dissatisfaction with the DCMA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act), which I feel is a little Draconian. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about CD-reading or physics or debuggers when I started those projects. I like to think that I&rsquo;ve helped a lot of people learn new fields by encouraging them to just jump in and get started.</p>
<p><strong> <strong>G: H</strong>ow do you prioritize what to work on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> In getting things done day to day, I often encounter annoyances, things that need to be addressed, and things that should be automated. I often have to deal with these by hand in order to get a task done, but later, I&rsquo;ll think about which things bothered me the most and ask how I can start to address them. I monitor statistics on my projects. For example, anyone who has a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">SourceForge</a>, or <a href="http://code.google.com/" target="_blank">code.google.com</a> account can star any number of other projects hosted on that organization. It costs nothing to flag a project.</p>
<p>When I&rsquo;m looking for something to work on, I&rsquo;ll look at the analytics for the various projects, and I will tend to work more on those with the most interest. The other kind of place I look at would be the download statistics that you can get from various package repositories: <a href="http://rubygems.org" target="_blank">RubyGems</a>, <a href="http://qa.debian.org/popcon.php" target="_blank">Debian QA</a>, <a href="http://pypi-ranking.info/alltime" target="_blank">PyPi Ranking</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What was your first open source project? And how many projects have you pursued in total?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> I started sharing code before the term &quot;open source&rdquo; was coined. In the old days, what you would do to let people know about your code was to write some an article about it for a magazine like <em>Byte</em> or <em>Dr. Dobb&rsquo;s Journal</em>. These magazines would have a place where you could download software mentioned in the articles. For some physics simulations I wrote with Greg Chatin at IBM Research. I arranged that, if people sent me a floppy disk and return postage, I&rsquo;d copy the programs onto that. Distribution by this method was very limited. A big breakthrough in distribution came from places like SourceForge, where they would host software that could be downloaded. </p>
<p><a href="https://masterbranch.com/rocky.bernstein#open-source-experience" target="_blank">This page</a> lists about 40 different open-source projects of mine. Not all of the projects are equal in size or weight, and some I am just a contributor on.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What do you think are the most important developments in the open-source community?<br/></strong></p>
<p>I mentioned public project repositories like SourceForge and GitHub, which make it easy to share code. At about the same time, maybe a little earlier, we started getting repositories for the various languages. Perl&rsquo;s CPAN was one of the oldest, and that clearly had a big impact on the language.</p>
<p>A feature of the early days was that you generally had to get someone&rsquo;s approval to share (or a magazine editor&rsquo;s decision that your software article was newsworthy). In order to get a CPAN account, for example, you needed to request an account, maybe list a project you were working on, and wait for someone to decide. The same is still true for GNU packages and Debian packages. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily wrong, but it limits the number of contributors.</p>
<p>Nowadays anyone can get an account on GitHub, SourceForge, or code.google.com. The process doesn&rsquo;t initially require someone&rsquo;s approval. But there have been many, many other improvements along the way; I have delighted in all of them:</p>
<ul><li>The various testing frameworks</li>
<li>Wikis on projects &ndash; anyone can write/improve documentation</li>
<li>Simple issue trackers</li>
<li>Public continuous integration systems like travis.org or drone.io with build status on the project page</li>
<li>irc, jabber, group jabber (e.g. Campfire)</li>
<li>Maybe code-review systems like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/" target="_blank">Rietveld</a>, although I think the jury is still out on those.</li>
</ul><p><strong>G: What do you think are the biggest challenges in successfully launching a project that will gain widespread adoption?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> For me, having a project hit the big time feels like hitting the lottery. For example, this Ruby debugger I had been working on hit the big time because someone in the Ruby on Rails project decided to add it as a configuration option. Neither of us working on the debugger were alerted to this possibility beforehand.</p>
<p>So what I do, and recommend doing, is just to focus on things you think important, and focus on the work. If you are lucky, something might happen.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are your favorite technologies right now?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> I&rsquo;m language-agnostic. In general, I prefer the dynamic languages (Ruby, Python, Lisp, Perl, POSIX Shell) over static ones (C++, C, Java), but recently I&rsquo;ve been working with Go, a static language, and I&rsquo;ll probably mention something there [at Tuesday&rsquo;s meetup].</p>
<p>I use GNU Emacs extensively and have for over 25 years. Initially I was impressed with its on-line help, and undo/redo. But most important from the beginning was the fact that it is completely programmable in a real programming language: Lisp. When I first looked at how Ruby was implemented in C, I found a remarkable similarity with how Emacs was implemented in C. The core Emacs functions are written in Lisp-like C, while Ruby is written in Ruby-like C. In both cases, they both do a lot with very little through the magic of orthogonality. I am impressed with how GNU Emacs, as old as it is, has evolved and adapted over the years.</p>
<p>Finally, having gone through four or so version control systems (SCCS, RCS, CVS, subversion) I&rsquo;m really happy with Git.</p>
<p><strong>Gilt: How did you find the Full-Stack Engineering meetup group?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB: </strong>NYC is full of diversity. Although I still feel like a visitor, and am constantly learning new things about NYC, I&rsquo;ve lived here for about 35 years. I really like the idea of Full-Stack Engineering. I joined the group because I want to hear what others have to offer, and so far things have been really great.</p>
<p><strong>Gilt: What do you hope to cover in your talk on Tuesday?</strong></p>
<p><strong>RB:</strong> I&rsquo;m going to try to keep things short, even though I feel passionate about the full-stack development process. There will just be a few things here and there where perhaps I can point out something that folks haven&rsquo;t heard of, or mention a project I&rsquo;m working on. I&rsquo;ll probably also suggest a project that I think should be worked on.</p>
<p><em>Thanks, Rocky!</em></p>

<p>Last Thursday Gilt had the pleasure of hosting Typesafe Developer Advocate <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/10/01/a-quick-catch-up-with-james-ward-of-typesafe" target="_blank">James Ward</a> and Director of Sales Tim Kirk, Akka Team member Henrik Engström, and a small group of NYC-based Typesafe platform enthusiasts for dinner at our 2 Park Ave. office. Over beer and Turkish food, about 27 of us spent a few hours talking about Typesafe&rsquo;s efforts to educate people on how to program in Scala, the future of Play Framework, object-relational mapping, and much more. Thanks to all of our guests for attending!</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to invite Henrik back to Gilt this Thursday to work from our office and hang out. More on that to come!</p>

<p><em>The crowd from last night&rsquo;s NYC Tech Talks event at Gilt&ndash;not an empty seat in the house!</em></p>
<p>Last night a standing-room only (!) crowd of software engineers, CTOs and other technologists came to our Manhattan office to catch &ldquo;Scaling Gilt: From Monolithic Ruby App to Distributed Scala Micro-Services,&rdquo; a tech talk by our very own <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2014/01/06/come-to-nyc-tech-talks-at-gilt-on-january-14" target="_blank">Yoni Goldberg</a>. Yoni, a lead software engineer on our <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/12/19/some-of-the-gilt-personalization-teams-favorite" target="_blank">personalization team</a>, gave a lively presentation that highlighted the reasons why we&rsquo;ve adopted a micro-services architecture, the lessons we&rsquo;ve learned along the way, and a few key questions every tech team should ask before developing a micro-services architecture of their own.</p>
<p>Check out Yoni&rsquo;s slides here:</p>

<p>Yoni&rsquo;s presentation was co-hosted by Gilt Tech and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Tech-Talks/" target="_blank">NYC Tech Talks</a>, one of NYC&rsquo;s top meetup groups for engineers. In addition to a fantastic crowd of tech professionals from Gilt, Facebook, Etsy, LinkedIn and other top companies, the night featured delicious food, post-presentation drinks and mingling, and lots of great conversations.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a photo-recap of the night&rsquo;s fun:</p>

<p>Yesterday <em>The Guardian</em> published a Q&amp;A with Gilt CEO Michelle Peluso. Just like the jewelry section on Gilt.com, the interview contains lots of gems&ndash;including this description by Michelle about our culture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First of all, Gilt has always been a phenomenal mix of creativity, technology and analytics, and that kind of mix between super creative people and design people: you know, photographers, stylists, merchandise experts, web designers sitting alongside analytical and technology fire power. [It] is such an interesting combination and provides a very vibrant culture, a mix of right brain and left brain.</p>
<p>Secondly, Gilt has always been a super innovative and fast paced culture. It has to be. Everyday we&rsquo;re putting on a new sale. Everyday, we&rsquo;re changing with what we have in our warehouse. And so, that pace of innovation is always a part of the culture.</p>
<p>Third, I would say, there&rsquo;s lot of celebration and fun at Gilt. We have to attract and attain the best people, so there&rsquo;s so many different things we do to keep that culture vibrant and fun and innovative. We have this legendary Halloween party, picnics, pantries that are full of food, team events, shopping discounts. Just lots of things that make working at Gilt fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On Thursday, January 16, Gilt VP Personalization Erik Lumer will be the featured presenter at the NYC Machine Learning group&rsquo;s monthly meetup. Erik will talk about the art of personalization in flash ecommerce&ndash;covering the unique challenges for personalization posed by an online flash sale business, the methods that Gilt has tested to foster novelty in the recommendations of personally relevant products, and other related topics. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Machine-Learning/events/159383292/" target="_blank">RSVP here</a> if you&rsquo;d like to attend Erik&rsquo;s talk, which starts at 7 PM at Pivotal Labs!</p>
<p>With nearly 4,500 members, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Machine-Learning/" target="_blank">NYC Machine Learning</a> is one of the most popular technology-related meetup groups in New York City. What has been the key to its success? And how has the group changed over time? Recently I asked meetup co-organizer (and Errplane CEO, InfluxDB core committer, and <em>Service Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails</em> author) <a href="http://pauldix.net" target="_blank">Paul Dix</a> to share his thoughts on these and other questions:</p>
<p><strong>Gilt:</strong> <strong>You started NYC Machine Learning in 2009.</strong> <strong>What sorts of meetups were you hosting then, and how were they different compared to your current events?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Paul Dix: </strong>In the very beginning I ran NYCML as a reading group. The format was something like this: I&rsquo;d select a paper in machine learning research or we&rsquo;d find one as a group, everyone would read the paper, and we&rsquo;d meet once a month to discuss it. The first two months followed this format. In the third month, someone suggested a talk they wanted to give. Ever since then, that&rsquo;s been the format of the group. Once a month, we get together to hear a talk from someone in academia, research, the start-up community, or business. The talks have covered a wide range of topics, including Artificial Intelligence, natural language processing, machine learning, search, information retrieval, big data infrastructure, and visualization.</p>
<p><strong>Of the (76!) meetups you&rsquo;ve hosted, which have been your favorites?<br/></strong></p>
<p>There have been so many fantastic talks that it&rsquo;s hard to pick. Taking a quick look back, I&rsquo;ll just pick four that caught my eye (of course, there are plenty more that I&rsquo;d include in this list). In ascending order by date:</p>
<ul><li>Princeton Professor Rob Schapire, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Machine-Learning/events/14438107/" target="_blank">Playing Repeated Games: Theory, an Algorithm, Applications</a>.&rdquo; I remember covering AdaBoost in class, so I was really excited to have him come speak. And his talk was really entertaining.</li>
<li>CMU Professor Cosma Shalizi, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Machine-Learning/events/14938792/" target="_blank">So, You Think You Have a Power Law, Do You? Well Isn&rsquo;t That Special</a>?&rdquo; <span>Cosma is a really well known statistician and has a great speaking style. This one was kind of a revelation to me as I had no idea that many things you think are power laws actually aren&rsquo;t.</span></li>
<li>Microsoft Machine Learning Research Scientist John Langford&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Machine-Learning/events/31554622/" target="_blank">Terrascale Learning</a>.&rdquo; John had given a talk at NYCML before, but this one was particularly awesome. The approach he used here blew my mind and made me completely rethink how Hadoop and distributed computing work.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Machine-Learning/events/127107922/" target="_blank">Peter Norvig</a>. Max, my co-organizer, roped Peter into presenting, and we just put his name on the event. In my favorites because, come on, Peter Norvig!</li>
</ul><p><strong>Why did you start the group?</strong></p>
<p>I started it for a couple of reasons. First was a purely selfish desire to try to stay current in machine learning and other topics that interest me. The second was that I wanted to help grow a machine learning community here in NYC. In 2007 I did an internship at Google, which holds internal machine learning meetups every two weeks. Google&rsquo;s meetups weren&rsquo;t open to the public, but the people who came and spoke at the meetings were great. [Google Director of Research] <a href="http://norvig.com/" target="_blank">Peter Norvig</a>, [Stanford professor] <a href="http://robotics.stanford.edu/~sahami/bio.html" target="_blank">Mehran Sahami</a>, and some other really heavy hitters would show up and participate in discussions or give talks. I wanted to see if I could reproduce the high caliber of those meetings for everyone here in NYC.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think are the key elements of your group&rsquo;s growth and success?<br/></strong></p>
<p>The most important factor has been consistency. Meeting up every month is huge. Every time I schedule a meetup, we get new members. The second factor: obviously fantastic speakers. Having presenters who come from academia and business has been great as well. With 4,500 members, we can&rsquo;t get everyone in a single room&ndash;so with varied topics, there&rsquo;s sure to be something every couple of months that any individual will probably be interested in. Finally, having a regular space has been really helpful. When everyone knows where to go, it&rsquo;s easier. You hosted us for a while in the beginning, then we spent a few years at AOL, and for the last few years we&rsquo;ve been at Pivotal. Having access to their space every month has been so helpful.</p>
<p><strong>As a seasoned meetup organizer, what do you think are the essentials to organizing a great event?<br/></strong></p>
<p>All the obvious things. Have a space that&rsquo;s easy for people to get to and find, offer a good setup for presenters, get an interesting speaker, and ask the speaker to provide as much detail as they can about the talk they&rsquo;ll be delivering. I usually tell speakers to keep the talk between 30 minutes and an hour. People&rsquo;s attention drops off after that, and besides, you want to give people time for questions and networking. I think it&rsquo;s also a good idea to keep the Q&amp;A time limited. People are there as much for the talk as they are to meet and talk to other people. Make sure there&rsquo;s time built in for it.</p>
<p><strong>Based on your observations, have any of the machine-learning topics that were &ldquo;hot&rdquo; in 2009 fizzled out or faded away? <br/></strong></p>
<p>I think recommender systems were much hotter in 2009 than they are today. I attribute that to the <a href="http://www.netflixprize.com/" target="_blank">Netflix Prize</a>, which was still going then. Once the team won, and Netflix decided not to implement the algorithm, it seemed everyone&rsquo;s excitement calmed down. Recommendation systems are still important, but it seems they&rsquo;re not as hot as they once were.</p>
<p><strong>Other than your own group, what are some of your favorites in NYC?<br/></strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-rb/" target="_blank">NYC.rb</a> meetup is the one I&rsquo;ve been going to the longest (since 2005). It&rsquo;s a great group of people, and the topics reach well beyond just Ruby. I&rsquo;m probably about 10x further along in programming and my career because of that group alone. Other ones of note: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/EmberJS-NYC/" target="_blank">Ember.js</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ctoschool/" target="_blank">CTO School</a>, the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hadoop-NYC/" target="_blank">New York Hadoop User Group</a>, and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/golangny/" target="_blank">Go Language New York</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What are your goals for NYC Machine Learning in 2014? <br/></strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to get someone from IBM&rsquo;s Watson to come give a talk. I&rsquo;d also like someone to give a talk on deep learning. Other than that, I&rsquo;ll be happy as long as we meet up at least once a month and have a great speaker to learn from.</p>
<p><em>Thanks for chatting, Paul!</em></p>
