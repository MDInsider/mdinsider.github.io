  <header>

  <div class="content">
    <p><strong><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/ac4c3421b765322e2febfeafdf6642be/tumblr_inline_mqk1fw61EI1qz4rgp.jpg"/></strong></p>

<p><strong>How long have you been at Gilt?</strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>Two years.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>How has program management at Gilt changed during that time?</strong> </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>When I started here, my job was more project-based: We’d get deployed on a project, then the project would end and we’d be deployed on another project with a different team. Now we have fairly stable teams, which enables program managers and teams to work together more efficiently. </span></p>
<p><span>Another change is that our approach is more data-driven than it once was. The teams get to decide&ndash;like mini start-ups&ndash;how they’re going to meet their KPIs (key performance indicators). </span></p>
<p><strong>How is program management different from project management?</strong></p>
<p><span>Instead of managing a specific project, a program manager manages and prioritizes multiple projects all at once for a specific program or area of the business. </span></p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your team.</strong></p>
<p><span>I’m the lead program manager for Gilt’s back office team, which includes more than 20 engineers who work on distribution, customer service, and business operations such as sales, finance, and creative. My team includes Ruby and Rails developers, Java people, Scala people&ndash;technology here is pretty fluid. We want everyone to feel empowered to do what they want and make their own decisions. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>How did you get into program management?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>After I earned my college degree in biology and chemistry, I worked in a lab. One day I thought to myself, “I don’t want to be stuck in a lab, never talking to anyone.” I decided to pursue programming, and started getting my masters degree in engineering. But then I realized that, once again, I was alone at 2 AM, coding. So I stopped programming. It was very hard to make that decision, because I don’t like to quit things. </span></p>
<p><span>I ended up at a crossroads. One weekend I came to visit a friend in NYC for her birthday, and just decided to stay and see what happened. I got a job within a week&ndash;not in tech, but at a small nutrition company. My responsibilities evolved into redesigning the student database and revising the website. I started working with my supervisors to define what we needed to do with our technology, and over the years we grew a tech team. While at that job I started researching project and program management, and learned the project life cycle from the ground up. That was 10 years ago. </span></p>
<p><strong>What makes a great program manager?</strong></p>
<p><span>I think you naturally tend to have a personality that lends itself to doing the job. I enjoy talking to people and getting things done. I love finding a problem and helping the team work through creative ways to solve it. I’ve worked at tech companies that followed Waterfall development practices and others that followed a more Agile approach: I appreciate both types, and layer methodologies from both into my project management style here at Gilt.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, I think if you’re a really good program or project manager, then the developers want you around to be there for them. I consider myself to be my team’s shield: I’m there to get business done, but also separate them from all the information that could be coming at them. </span></p>
<p><strong>If you had to name some key traits that every program manager should have, what would they be?</strong></p>
<p><span>A key trait you need is to be a really good listener and be able to explain things to both business and technical stakeholders. You have to be an effective liaison and manage other departments’ expectations. You also have to know how to explain concepts and ideas in a non-technical way, but also understand what the tech team is saying. </span></p>
<p><strong>Like being a translator.</strong></p>
<p><span>In a lot of ways. Every project involves lots of stakeholders, and they’re each going to want to have their say. It’s my job to manage all of that and establish a relationship with each person. I take in the information, figure out the best strategy, and make sure that all the stakeholders understand and agree with the plan in some way.</span></p>
<p><strong>So it’s also like being a diplomat.</strong></p>
<p><span>Yes. A large part of my job is developing relationships, so that when there’s an issue we can just chat about it and it’s not so formal. It’s about building trust, so that the other person knows you’re going to tell them the truth, and that if you don’t know the answer, you’ll find it and be there for them. </span></p>
<p><strong>How do you stay up-to-date on the technologies we use?</strong></p>
<p><span>Most of the learning is done by osmosis. I read tech blogs and books, but it’s really more about listening to the developers and trying to get in on those conversations. You don’t always have to know the technology at the same level as they do, but it helps. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>How does program management at Gilt compare to other companies’ processes?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Here, you can’t be super-rigid. Gilt follows Agile principles, so you have to know how to take projects apart and work on them piece by piece. It’s a more flexible way of doing things, with more iteration. We focus on getting out the minimum viable product and iterating on it once it’s been released. </span></p>
<p><strong>How often do you meet with other program managers?</strong></p>
<p><span>Our program management operations team meets every week. It’s a way for all of us to find out what’s going on across the organization, and to talk about the impacts of our initiatives. We go to a lot of social events together, to help us stay connected. And we also go to trainings, either taught by outside instructors or Heather [Fleming, </span><span>Senior Director, </span><span>Program Management Office]. </span></p>
<p><strong>What have been your biggest accomplishments at Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>Before joining the back office team, I worked with the Stores Platform team</span><span> </span><span>and helped launch keyword search. That initiative significantly changed how people shop on Gilt by enabling us to better serve not only browsing customers, but also customers with specific needs. We also created a unified navigation, which brought all of our stores under one unified brand. That project involved all the teams at Gilt, and required agreement from all the department heads. </span></p>
<p><strong>What are you working on these days?</strong></p>
<p><span>The back-end team is developing a new customer service app so that we can support our customers more quickly and easily. We’re also working on reworking our business processes to gain efficiencies in our workflow, and create a data flow that’s seamless from one enterprise application to the next. My biggest priority is to nail down our road map: to gain consensus on what we will focus on in the next few months. And of course, dealing with all the changes along the way!</span></p>

<p>With so much of the NYC tech scene focused on software development, web development, and cloud-y things, it&rsquo;s easy to overlook all the innovation taking place in the city&rsquo;s clean tech, bioscience, robotics, and other hard-science scenes. One of the organizations working to promote the hard sciences locally is <a href="http://nyctechconnect.com/" target="_blank">NY Tech Connect</a>, a nonprofit organization that creates programs and events for start-ups and entrepreneurs that make tangible products. Last night I attended NY Tech Connect&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://nyctechconnect.com/tech-you-can-touch.html" target="_blank">Technology You Can Touch</a>,&rdquo; a showcase of sorts at <a href="https://www.wework.com/" target="_blank">WeWork</a> that featured these young companies:</p>
<p><a href="http://studentweb.poly.edu/~innovention/bot-factory/" target="_blank"><strong>BOT Factory</strong></a>: Founded by a pair of NYU students, BOT Factory is working on a 3D circuit printer so that you can one day make circuit boards in the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.keyme.net/" target="_blank"><strong>KeyMe</strong></a>: Disrupting the locksmithing industry, KeyMe enables you to make copies of your house and office keys and store digital copies in the cloud. The company has already set up key-making kiosks at a few locations in NYC, so if you&rsquo;re in the habit of losing your keys you might find this one useful.</p>
<p><a href="http://columbiabusinesslab.com/ventures/" target="_blank"><strong>Radicle Orthopedics</strong></a>: Part of the Columbia Business Lab, Radicle works with surgeons and medical device manufacturers on healthcare-related products.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.strongarmvest.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Strongarm Vest</strong></a>: Not to be confused with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Bad" target="_blank">Strongbad <em>mask</em></a>, Strongarm Vest helps make lifting heavy objects easier and safer by redistributing weight from the arms and lower back to the stronger parts of the torso. A winner of the Rochester and New York State Business Plan Competitions, Strongarm was inspired by the founders&rsquo; own experiences watching their construction-worker relatives deal with pains and injuries sustained on the job.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lumiode.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Lumiode</strong></a>: Based in Brooklyn, this company focuses on making super-bright, energy-efficient, LED micro-displays.</p>
<p><a href="http://mykeenhome.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Keen Home</strong></a>: This company&rsquo;s automated air vents are designed to reduce excessive air conditioning and HVAC run times (by up to 30 percent, they claim).</p>
<p><a href="http://canary.is/" target="_blank"><strong>Canary</strong></a>: Billed by its founders as &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s first smart home security device for everyone,&rdquo; Canary alerts you via smartphone to suspicious or out-of-the-ordinary goings-on at your home. Canary launched a $100,000 Indiegogo campaign just this week and has already surpassed the $500,000 mark, so expect to hear lots more from them.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Coactive</strong>: This company works in the area of vibration technology. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.onemedplace.com/database/list/cid/16322/" target="_blank">Vesselon</a>: </strong>This healthcare start-up is developing a device that will enable paramedics to treat stroke victims as early as possible and, they hope, improve patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Looking forward to what NY Tech Connect and the companies above present next. Congrats to all involved for creating a thought-provoking and inspiring event.</p>

<p><br/><span></span><strong>When did you start working at Gilt?</strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>I moved to NYC right out of college at the end of 2009, and started working at Gilt not long after that. At the time Gilt was still a startup, and was building out its quality assurance operations. I was hired to be a manual tester, which meant testing small features and changes on a day-to-day basis. Eventually I branched out into automation.</span></p>
<p><strong>Although you were a QA engineer, you found ways to develop your coding skills. </strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>In my early days at Gilt, I got automation and release management experience, which involved code coverage from Selenium tests, migrating code from an engineer’s commit to testing in stage, and getting the code to production. In 2011, I realized that I wanted more coding experience than that, so I enrolled in a Java Web Services course at NYU’s School of Professional Studies. Earning my certificate really helped me measure and prove that I knew how to code. I highly recommend that course, by the way.</span></p>
<p><strong>Was Gilt supportive of your Java study?</strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>Yes. I mean, it was all on me that I pushed myself to do it&ndash;no one else was going to do that for me. But there’s a lot of support here. There’s no traditional ladder to climb&ndash;working here is all about making sure you push yourself to new levels. People want to see you succeed.</span></p>
<p><span>More recently, I took the <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/06/20/sign-up-for-free-scala-training-at-gilt" target="_blank">Scala class</a> that Gilt hosted at our NYC office. It’s great that the company is investing in teaching us new skills. Even nicer was that the class was completely free and open to anyone. I just wish it had been longer than one day.</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>After you finished the Java certificate, how did you apply your new skills on the job?</strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>Other engineers here knew that I wanted to learn how to code, so one of my colleagues taught me front-end development, and Yoni [Goldberg, Popeye Team lead engineer] taught me about service-side/back-end coding.</span></p>
<p><span>While still enrolled in the course I started diving into front-end development, and helped out with small features. After I got my Java certificate, I started taking on features by myself, and eventually was promoted to software engineer. I’ve since been a member of Gilt’s Popeye team, which works on the Login &amp; Registration experience, SEO optimizations, and the new Insider loyalty program. Because of my QA experience I’ve been helping Popeye with our automation coverage while gradually becoming a full-time developer and taking on new features with the Scrum team.</span><span> </span><span>Like all of Gilt’s engineers, I’m expected to take product leadership and own my features.</span></p>
<p><strong>How do you decide which projects to work on?</strong></p>
<p><span>Because I’m still a junior engineer, I look for the smaller projects that can result in a higher ROI on a low amount of input for changing code. Recently I worked on </span><a href="http://www.gilt.com/account/waitlist" target="_blank"><span>Gilt’s wait-list page</span></a><span>; the project involved UX, and no other engineers were free to take it, so I took it up.</span></p>
<p><strong>How did Yoni and Team Popeye support you?</strong><span></span></p>
<p><span>Yoni gave me the push and said, ‘it’s a great project, no one’s doing it, I think you should take it on.’ I was pretty skeptical about doing it by myself at first, but I dove into it and, piece by piece, it started to come along. All the engineers on my team know how to write code in service-side, so they helped me figure out how to do something scalable while not jeopardizing performance.</span></p>
<p><span>Because of the small projects I worked on prior to wait-list, I knew my way around the code base. The work was really fun. I had to wait a bit for the rollout of other features until I could turn on my own&ndash;but this was good, because I wasn’t sure how great my work was, or if it would cause problems. Having to wait gave me time to make sure my work was iron-clad and address edge cases that came up over time.</span></p>
<p><strong>Old wait list: </strong><img height="251px;" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cygMXsI2OU6bXmAOdZvuzrS41pfwpG8Alp9dO9f4CVa6E3Az4h7789MAs50bgPIpTjgRawd8jDxTrsL_g9b4gkmuQ8L25U6U1VGzmwCMGeY_P22Y6hKiUB4_" width="502px;"/><span></span></p>
<p><strong>New Waitlist:</strong><img height="493px;" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DRnQwWsVpq9y7O0kW2IPFfJEi-mGKg8DaGUR9IPAM5uAVmWfUJey9vzKjN31-XFfu_McCHgf4LJxpEbGODz2088edYeycMyND9b-Rb_Ra4YP4TMhnug-D9pR" width="531px;"/><span></span></p>
<p><br/><span></span></p>
<p><strong>How do you generally respond to setbacks?</strong></p>
<p><span>You can’t call anything that happens &ldquo;bad,” because you learn from every experience. Bugs can hurt revenue and your metrics, but it’s one of those things where, if you do something wrong, you learn never to do it again. At Gilt, we evaluate why things sometimes go wrong, as opposed to taking a “move on and don’t look back” approach. We try to put as many safeguards in place as possible, to prevent problems.</span></p>
<p><span>To avoid issues, we have strong code reviews, high levels of test coverage and great tools for deploys.</span></p>
<p><strong>Doesn’t code review act like a personal progress measurement of sorts?</strong></p>
<p><span>Yes, kind of. Starting out, I had tons of iterations, and then they became fewer and fewer. That’s when I knew I was getting better. My goal was to have fewer complaints.</span></p>
<p><span>The engineers looking over my code were hard on me, but this was helpful to me in getting the fundamentals down and knowing why things are done a certain way. Even seemingly minor issues like a missing space they would call out, just so I’d be up to the standards they were expecting. You don’t write code for yourself&ndash;you write it for others, or for yourself a year or two from now.</span></p>
<p><strong>In one word, how would you describe Gilt&rsquo;s work culture?</strong></p>
<p><span>Empowering. People here are willing to help you do what interests you. If you identify a need, and want to help fill that need, the company responds. That’s what gives you more opportunities to succeed.</span></p>
<p><strong>Any advice for engineers who are just starting out?</strong></p>
<p><span>Technology&rsquo;s always changing, but it keeps you on your game. You&rsquo;re always learning something. That&rsquo;s what an engineer is&ndash;someone who can pick up a project and figure it out, solve the problem, without knowing much of anything about it.</span></p>
<p><span>The hardest time for a young or new developer is the beginning. But over time, and with perseverance, you&rsquo;ll gain confidence and know that you can build something out. Pick fun projects, and enjoy what you&rsquo;re doing.</span></p>

<p>Recently Gilt had the pleasure of hosting a group of young women from <a href="http://www.girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a>&ndash;a nonprofit organization aimed at achieving gender parity in the technology sector. This was the second time we hosted GWC; last year&rsquo;s delegation <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2012/08/08/a-big-thanks-to-this-years-girls-who-code-field" target="_blank">voted us</a> as the #1 workplace, so we aimed to live up to our reputation.</p>
<p>We started things off by giving the girls a brief introduction to Gilt Tech, including an overview of our agile development process and a description of the tech team roles. We then divided the group into teams of three and asked each team to design a web page based on the theme, &ldquo;welcoming Girls Who Code to Gilt.&rdquo; Some of the girls had HTML experience, others did not, but they all quickly found roles&ndash;including project manager, UX designer or coder. They formed mini-versions of our Gilt teams! We were very impressed with their work:</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/e3b98648d43fe2cfb29c9e365e6b54af/tumblr_inline_mq272ypKHR1qz4rgp.png"/></p>

<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-67dba9e8-f363-08d7-1afd-c5fe861e45be">The web page exercise turned out to be a hit&ndash;the girls didn&rsquo;t want to stop working!<br/></span></p>
<p>The visit ended with a tour of the Gilt office and a question/answer session featuring Gilt women technologists. The girls&rsquo; energy was inspiring to see&ndash;it&rsquo;s clear that they are all extremely intelligent, driven and have bright futures ahead of them. We look forward to seeing them again in their careers!</p>

  <h1><a href="/2013/07/18/lucene-scala">Pour a Little (Lucene) Sugar in Your Scala</a></h1>
  
  <header>
    
    <time>18 July 2013</time>

  <div class="content">
    <p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/689973072f136d815ee3cc8394303d36/tumblr_inline_mq5gfqDfxh1qz4rgp.jpg"/></p>
<p>Please say hello to <a href="https://github.com/gilt/lib-lucene-sugar" target="_blank">Lucene Sugar</a>: a library that provides a more concise syntax for the Lucene API in the Scala language. Lucene Sugar makes it easier to:</p>
<ul><li>compose Lucene indexes using the familiar Scala cake pattern</li>
<li>add indexed and/or stored fields to a Lucene document</li>
<li>index collections of documents</li>
<li>search! (You didn’t really expect that, did you?)</li>
</ul><p>My general goal for Lucene Sugar is to turn some standard operations on their head. For example, instead of:</p>
<p><code>scala val doc = new Document doc.add(new StringField("string_field", "aString", Store.YES)) doc.add(new LongField("long_field", 123456L, Store.NO)) doc.add(new StoredField("int_field", 10))</code></p>
<p>you can now write:</p>
<p><code>scala val doc = new Document doc.addIndexedStoredField("string_field", "aString") doc.addIndexedOnlyField("long_field", 123456L) doc.addStoredOnlyField("int_field", 10)</code></p>
<p>Lucene Sugar is still in its infancy, but I believe it already offers great value to anyone wishing to use Lucene in Scala code.</p>
<p><strong>Why I Created Sugar<br/></strong></p>
<p>Gilt&rsquo;s inventory includes millions of different items in limited quantities. These items are sold quickly, which means that our inventory is constantly changing. A few weeks ago I found that I needed a data store capable of:</p>
<ul><li>storing items composed of text and numbers</li>
<li>being indexed and filtered using extremely specific criteria (for example, all white shirts from Paul Smith that can be shipped to Canada)</li>
<li>working quickly and efficiently (a few 100ms per query)</li>
<li>being embeddable (I wanted the data management to be self-contained in the service without requiring any external dependencies</li>
</ul><p>I&rsquo;d used Lucene for other projects, and thought it might be a great fit for what I needed. In fact, it turned out that&ndash;despite its wordy API&ndash;Lucene works very well. To overcome the excess verbiage issue, I added some &ldquo;Scala syntactic sugar&rdquo; around the Lucene API to make it more concise and pleasant to use. After doing some coding, I realized that it could be helpful to convert this higher-level API into a library that could be reused in other projects. (I also badly wanted to publish my first open source Scala project, so this was a very good candidate.)</p>
<p>With Lucene Sugar, we can now build a search and browser service on top of our inventory data; the data is composed of textual attributes such as product name, brand, color and description as well as numeric data like price and size. I hope you find it useful as well!</p>
