<p>Gilt VP Architecture Eric Bowman is the next featured speaker at <a href="http://www.refreshingcitiesdublin.org/" target="_blank">Refresh Dublin</a>: an event series, inspired by the <a href="http://refreshingcities.org/" target="_blank">Refreshing Cities</a> movement, that explores the relationships between design, UX and technology. On Tue 10/15, Eric will present &ldquo;Symmetry, Scala &amp; Software&rdquo;&ndash;an updated iteration of <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/06/11/gilt-tech-presents-at-scala-days-slides" target="_blank">his Scala Days talk</a>&ndash;at the Science Gallery in Dublin. More details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The concept of symmetry is pervasive across many fields: art, architecture, mathematics, even fashion. In the past decade or so, technologists have begun to talk about symmetry in the context of programming languages and the software programs created with them.</p>
<p>In this talk, we’ll explore the meaning and significance of symmetry beyond its superficial, primarily visual characteristics, and connect it to the practice of writing software. In particular, we’ll take a look at the Scala programming language, which manifests a profound degree of internal design symmetry.  We’ll also look at how that symmetry facilitates writing programs that are compact, elegant, and minimal. Finally, examine the importance of breaking symmetry, and introduce some new ideas around refactoring and conservation principles.</p>
</blockquote>

  <h1><a href="/2013/10/10/hadoop-vs-aster-a-quick-comparison">Hadoop vs. Aster: A Quick Comparison</a></h1>
  
  <header>
    
    <time>10 October 2013</time>
    
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>If you’ve got more data than money, you’re probably checking out open source data analytics platforms. But how well do these no- or low-cost alternatives perform in comparison to their more expensive, licensed counterparts? Curious about the answer, I recently conducted an experiment to determine the feasibility of using Hadoop instead of <a href="http://www.asterdata.com/" target="_blank">Aster</a>, the licensed analytics platform the Gilt data team uses to store and manage our vast data resources. The TL; DR result: Hadoop performs well in comparison for some use cases.</p>
<h3>Methodology and setup</h3>
<p><span>In planning my experiment, I didn’t set out to make an extensive evaluation of either Aster or Hadoop&ndash;rather, I wanted to quickly explore how to stand up a Hadoop cluster, then compare it to Aster. I could have made a variety of different optimizations on both platforms during testing, but I wanted to limit the scope of my evaluation to complete it within a reasonable amount of time.</span></p>
<p><span>Our data team had an eight-node Aster cluster available for testing, and Hortonworks’ documentation recommended setting up clusters in multiples of three to support the default replication factor of three, so my test involved eight Aster nodes vs. nine Hadoop nodes. The exact setup: </span></p>
<ul><li>
<p><span>Aster 5.0.2 on eight nodes, with a replication factor of two</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Hortonworks 2.0 Community Preview distribution on nine nodes, with a default replication factor of three</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span></span><span>Hive 0.11</span></p>
</li>
</ul><h3>What I evaluated, and why</h3>
<p><span>For test data, I used two months of raw, Gilt clickstream data&ndash;approximately 900 million rows (~120GB compressed on disk). To test Aster, I used an unindexed, row storage table. To test Hadoop, I chose two table formats: raw gzip compressed files logically partitioned by month, and an Optimized Row Columnar (ORC) table with compression [</span><a href="http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.0.0.2/ds_Hive/orcfile.html" target="_blank"><span>ORC Format</span></a><span>]. The load times between Aster and Hadoop column store were comparable.</span></p>
<p><span>A few notes:</span></p>
<ul><li>
<p><span>The load into Aster includes time to decompress gzipped files</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>The load into the Hadoop column store table was done using the raw Hadoop table, so the actual load time includes the loading of the raw Hadoop table.</span></p>
</li>
</ul><p><span>To compare the results of performance tests using Aster, Hadoop with raw data, and Hadoop with column store data, I used identical data sets in all tests; ran the tests at times when there was no other activity on the cluster; and made some basic query optimizations as described in the documentation for Hive. Once again, lower was better.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Regarding the query performance of progressively larger data-sets on Hadoop and Aster, I performed the test using a single-column table with an increasing number of rows&ndash; first one row, then 10K, 1 million, 1 billion, 10 billion, and 20 billion&ndash;and at times when there was no other activity on the cluster. Comparable performance once again.</span></p>
<p><span>After running this evaluation, I&rsquo;ve concluded that HDFS can be useful for storing raw data (log files, etc.) or archival of older transformed data. But the day-to-day activities in the data warehouse space (SQL, analysis, etc.) should remain in Aster. HDFS is not a perfect substitution: For example, I’ve also noted that Hive requires some effort and patience to get it working; it’s unstable when using with embedded metastores. And sometimes it throws exceptions for which I wasn’t able to find resolutions: for example, “java.sql.SQLException: Error retrieving next row,” and&ndash;when selecting from ORC tables&ndash;“java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space error.” (Using MySQL to store metadata seemed to improve Hive’s stability.)  </span></p>
<p><span>Other problems: Orphaned/Zombie jobs could be problematic&ndash;you need to manually intervene to kill those jobs. You need to be careful when designing table structures, because that is the biggest factor in performance of queries (storage format, compression, clustering, partitioning, skew, serde). Finally, Hadoop’s concurrency sucks: The first query/job receives the bulk of your resources. (The documentation says that significant improvements were made in the resource manager, known as YARN, but sometimes jobs/queries are blocked until a running job/query completes.)</span></p>
<h3>Running your own test</h3>
<p><span><span>There are still many unexplored options for optimizing for performance. If you can identify some real-world use cases, then you can optimize Hive with logical partitioning, physical partitioning (clustering), sorted data storage, and indexing. Similarly, you can also optimize Aster to use column stores, logical partitioning, physical partitioning, indexing, etc. </span></span></p>

<p>Tomorrow (Thu 10/10) marks the opening of <a href="http://www.moma.org/learn/kids_families/labs#current" target="_blank"><em>MoMA Art Lab: Movement</em></a>, a new exhibition at New York City&rsquo;s Museum of Modern Art&ndash;and Gilt mobile engineer Ruxy Staicut is one of the featured artists. Ruxy&rsquo;s piece, titled &ldquo; Dra'wii'ng Jackson Pollock,&rdquo; is an interactive installation that invites people create art pieces inspired by the painting styles of Jackson Pollock and other artists by using technology on projected canvases.<br/><br/>Ruxy first worked on the installation&ndash;a collaboration with UX/UI designer <a href="http://www.siontheweb.net/SI-HEUN-CHO" target="_blank">Si Heun Cho</a>&ndash;during her first semester as a graduate student in NYU/Tisch School of the Art&rsquo;s Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP), which combines art and technology. The main idea of the piece, which was originally inspired by a documentary about Jackson Pollock, is to use existing technology to create digital art pieces with similar movements the artist used. Recently the MoMA discovered Ruxy&rsquo;s work online and, with the Art Lab&rsquo;s Movement theme in mind, invited her to exhibit. The project has been further expanded from Jackson Pollock to use the same technology and movement for other artist styles.<br/><br/>MoMA&rsquo;s Art Lab program offers kids and adults opportunities to explore and create art, discuss their ideas and interact with the work of other creators. Movement runs through August 31, 2014, so you&rsquo;ve got plenty of time to catch it!</p>

Named one of <em>Crain NY</em>&rsquo;s &ldquo;40 Under 40,&rdquo; Perlich has won the Advertising Research Foundation’s (ARF) Grand Innovation Award as well as many data competitions, and is a frequent speaker at industry and academic events. She earned her PhD in Information Systems from NYU, teaches at her alma mater&rsquo;s business school, and holds several patents in machine learning.</p>
<p>Claudia was kind enough to answer a few of our questions about her work, the world of big data, and her many outside interests.</p>
<p><span><strong>In your talk at Gilt a few weeks ago (organized by the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/BIGDataDivas/" target="_blank">DataDivas</a> meetup group) you made the point that the art of predictive analytics involves making do with second-best, because there is no &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; data set. How do you know when it&rsquo;s time to accept what is and make do with the data you have? (It&rsquo;s probably situational, but some best practices might be helpful.)</strong> </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>That is an advantage of predictive modeling: In the end, it all translates to how well a model performs in the deployment setting, and that I can hopefully measure correctly by recreating the exact use scenario. I have to be extremely diligent when measuring whether the model is good enough for my purpose. Once you are certain about your evaluation, you can decide when to stop looking for better. </span></p>
<p><span>All this comes back to the notion that you must know the exact use for your model, and this is where you are correct and it is very situational. For automated stock trading, you need top performance. For sentiment analysis, being in the right ballpark is often enough. For medical diagnosis, one type of mistake is much worse than the other. And in advertising, raw predictive performance is just one of the many metrics that matter.</span><span></span></p>
<div class="im">
<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve written that &ldquo;For me, clean data (cleansed by somebody else) is dead. It has lost its soul.&rdquo; When data loses its soul, what is the effect on the general public? </strong><span></span></p>
<span></span></div>
<p><span>This wasn’t meant to be a religious statement&ndash;it is a personal attitude. What happens when somebody cleans the data is that it loses the vital details that help me to identify all the potential issues. I can no longer ‘debug’ the data. The result, typically, is that I am missing something that ultimately will limit the performance I can tease out of it. </span></p>
<p><span>Think of it as a detective game: if somebody has cleaned the scene of the crime, you will have a hard time finding out what actually happened and your chances of catching the bad guy decrease considerably.</span><span> </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>So, what is the effect on the general public? The data will be less useful, and we will realize later than necessary that the way we collected the data had issues, the insights gleaned from it are potentially biased, and it will take us longer to discover that than it should. There are no obvious threats&ndash;it just limits our ability to utilize the full potential of the data.</span><span></span></p>
<div class="im"><span></span><strong>Big data is a hot topic these days. What are the pros and cons of this development? What would you like to see emerge from all the big-data talk taking place right now?</strong><span></span></div>
<p><span>There are two major pros of very different nature. On the technology side, the advances of cheap data collection and storage make the advantages of data analytics available to all layers of both the economy and society: from schools and nonprofits to startups and the big players. At the same time, the hype around big data has fueled a tremendous excitement about using data and created an unprecedented demand for data scientists, which in turn has translated to an influx of talent. I have always seen the opportunities, and soon, due to the increased manpower and skill, we might actually get to realize them. There might be a few disappointments on the rocky road, but I am excited about the future.</span><span></span></p>
<div class="im">
<p><span><strong>Of all the technological advancements in the big data field over the past few years, which would you say has been the most significant, and why?</strong> </span><span></span></p>
<span></span><span>Clearly, the most amazing advancement is the lower cost of collecting and storing data, while making access extremely fast and easy. Gone are the days of storing data somewhere on tape and needing 30 days to access it. Today we live in a world where we can collect terrabytes daily and still access some tiny slice of it from May 4, 2010 in about one minute. This possibility opens the door to much more elaborate analysis AND, more importantly, allows every analysis to start from the raw data rather than starting with the curated (and soulless) aggregated summaries. </span><span></span><br/><span></span>
<p><strong>In Gilt&rsquo;s work with personalization, we have to be mindful of the line that separates delivering value from being too invasive. What are your thoughts on that dividing line?</strong><span></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>That is actually a very interesting discussion. My personal experience has been that I am perfectly fine with invisible, good use of data&ndash;I expect you to do it, and, moreover, I expect you to be good at it. Examples are recommendation systems in Amazon or Netflix. I am VERY much aware that I share a lot of data, and I expect it to be used to the mutual benefit of companies and consumers. In fact, I have been repeatedly disappointed by some of the recommendations that I have been given, and often “say” to my device of the moment, “You should know me better than that!” </span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, I had an epiphany while reading a German newspaper, and all of a sudden a message appeared recommending an article that a friend of mine had read. This must have come from data only Facebook could have had, and on that day I decided to delete my Facebook account.  So having it used behind the scenes (and I am very much aware that this is happening) doesn’t bother me nearly as much as a blatant attempt to manipulate me by pushing the ‘social connection’ buttons openly. That is where I drew the line in the sand. But maybe that is just me.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Generally I think that it really should be within the power of the consumer to have a voice as to how his or her data can be used. The broader issue is a lack of information of what is done with what data, and to whose benefit. The reality is consumers don’t know who is doing what with their data, and they lack a full understanding of the economic implications. For most purposes (recommendations, search and many others) I am very comfortable with sharing data and having it used. I am also aware that, while one can switch off tracking, that will not make advertising go away. I will still see ads, just much more bothersome ones, and some with potentially nefarious side effects. </span></p>
<p><span>On some level, the advertising industry, when it works well, is serving as a wealth redistribution system that ultimately fuels much of the information technology infrastructure. Today everyone expects infrastructure (blog hosting, etc.) AND information to be free. And arguably advertising is footing the bill of all the user-generated and ‘non-paid for’ content to be freely available on blogs, news sites, apps, etc. Unfortunately, the trade-off is often invisible and not up to the choice of the user.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>You touched upon this issue in your discussion of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=2&amp;hp&amp;" target="_blank">Target</a>. More on that, for our readers?<br/></strong></span></p>
<p><span>In my opinion, the Target case is primarily a testimony to the power of data and the quality of their analysis. The reality is that every day parents are realizing one way or another that their daughter is pregnant. But in this case, it was traceable to an act of data mining and makes for a great story in the day and age of big data (and Big Brother watching you). But what we aren’t told is how often the mailer went to the wrong family, and how many expecting families were very happy to receive them.  </span><span></span></p>
<div class="im">
<p><span><strong>What&rsquo;s on your &ldquo;essential reading&rdquo; list (books, websites, specific writers/data scientists)?</strong></span><span></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>On the work-related reading list, one book that completely changed my viewpoint of modeling and data more than 15 years ago is William Greene’s <em>Econometrics</em>. It is really technical, but I feel that it truly conveys the important parts of statistical thinking around modeling. The other books that I hold in high regard from the machine-learning side are <em>Elements of Statistical Learning</em> (Hastie et al.) and “Pattern Classification” (Duda et al.). A great book for people with less of a technical background but an interest in using data in various business applications is <em>Data Science for Business</em> by Foster Provost and Tom Fawcett. I am currently using it in my MBA course at NYU.</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>As for reading for fun?</strong></p>
<p><span>For fun, I like fiction/science fiction, including things like <em>Too Many Curses</em> by Lee Martinez, the “Bartimeous Trilogy” by Jonathan Stroud, and I very much enjoy books on biology, evolution, etc. (Dawkins, Waal, Hitchens).</span><span></span></p>
<div class="im">
<p><span></span><strong><a href="http://mycrains.crainsnewyork.com/40under40/profiles/2013/claudia-perlich" target="_blank">This article</a> notes that every year you learn something new. How do you choose what that new thing is? And how do those new things help you develop new insights into your work?</strong><span></span></p>
</div>
<p><span>I have never given much thought to the selection process. I guess something just catches my attention, or there is an opportunity and I jump at it. It isn’t a strategic thing that I do with a specific purpose, but it’s driven more by the people I interact with. I would say that it reflects a deeply rooted curiosity and also the habit of challenging myself. </span></p>
<p><span>I just really love to be able to do things. For instance, through some random accident, I came across a carbon fiber cello a few years earlier and could not resist buying it. I love music, I play piano and I really like the warm and round tone of the cello. So last year, when my son started playing double bass at school and was starting to learn the basics, it was the perfect opportunity for me to jump in and learn as well. </span></p>
<p><strong>What did you learn this year?</strong></p>
<p><span>This summer I took on springboard diving because someone at the local pool was giving lessons to the kids. It is one of these things I always admired&ndash;the beauty of it, the control and skill of making something really difficult look absolutely amazing and easy. So really&ndash;there is no direct relationship to work other than the ‘I can do this’ attitude. </span></p>

  <header>

  <div class="content">
    <p><img alt="image" src="http://media.tumblr.com/6659efee20f97416b9f129f9d750d35e/tumblr_inline_mu5fdcBuLu1s17bu5.jpg"/></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-4ff8659b-83ea-76ae-ac59-b8f638f367fc"><strong>What do you do at Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;m a senior software engineer who works on the platform team in Dublin. I focus on integrating the load and performance testing platform into Ion Cannon.</span></p>
<p><strong>What did you do before joining us?</strong></p>
<p><span>Before I came to Gilt this past summer, I was with Amazon for five years. I owned the cart service for 2 years, then moved on to the monitoring group, where I spent time with the user experience group, and then the logs team.</span></p>
<p><span>Before that, I spent five years with a Galway-based telecom start-up. I also worked for Full Tilt Poker for a while (but I swear I had nothing to do with them going under. Poker players will know what happened there).</span></p>
<p><strong>What are some other interesting things we should know about you?</strong></p>
<p><span>I&rsquo;m originally from Romania, and have lived in Ireland for the past 12-plus years. I&rsquo;m in love with American football, and have been a Denver Broncos fan since 1996. Right now the Broncos are 4-0, have broken a few records, and are favorites to win the Super Bowl, so that all makes me happy. I run virtual machines at home, but they’re all just pet projects.</span></p>
<p><strong>When did you start programming?</strong></p>
<p><span>I started in high school. Computers were not very common in communist Romania, but I encountered them as part of a class trip to a university in Craiova&ndash;my hometown. The university had an IT center, and after that trip I transferred to the appropriate class there and learned coding. I ended up building programs in Fortran for students who needed them for their university classes. I did this for a few hours every day&ndash;so much so, that my parents firmly believed that my high school classes took 10 hours a day!</span></p>
<p><span>After high school I went to the CS college so I could follow this route. I&rsquo;ve been coding ever since. Even if the coding work was not for class, I would write code for other stuff. I also learned many languages, starting with Fortran and Basic, then Pascal, then C++.</span></p>
<p><strong>How did you get to Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>I had heard that Gilt would be a very good fit for my skills set. And Gilt agreed. Basically, my current team’s needs matched my skills very well from my previous work at Amazon, and I was looking for a new challenge, so I said yes to the opportunity.</span></p>
<p><strong>Thinking back to your interview, what stood out for you most?</strong></p>
<p><span>It seemed there were some opportunities to start some new initiatives from scratch&ndash;opportunities that I hadn&rsquo;t had in my previous jobs, where I had to do a lot of legacy work. I was attracted by the performance engineering domain, because it’s one thing that helps and empowers developers to improve and control the quality of their work. </span></p>
<p><strong>What did you think about joining a Scala shop like Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>I see languages as tools for the job. I don’t see myself as a Java developer, or a Scala developer, but as a software developer. I think you shouldn’t get stuck with one tool&ndash;you should diversify and learn the trade of development, and not focus all your energy on how to operate a specific tool.</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve always learned new tools for different projects that I’ve encountered along the way. I can write code in a very large number of languages, not all of them to great quality, but if need be I can ramp up my skills. In my career, I first learned and used C++, so at Amazon I first moved to the C++ team. Then I moved over to Java and learned it on the job. Now I&rsquo;m learning Scala on the job. I did the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun" target="_blank">Coursera course</a></span><span></span><span>, and am now getting a lot of help from my teammates on code reviews.</span></p>
<p><strong>What do you appreciate most about Scala?</strong></p>
<p><span>Scala offers so many ways to write the same thing. Some ways are more succinct than others, and I’m trying to write the kind of code that other people will like to read and maintain.</span></p>
<p><span>Working with people who have very good programming skills has been very helpful.</span></p>
<p><strong>What have you been working on since you got here?</strong></p>
<p><span>In my first few months I designed a log aggregation solution and wrote a few of my first services in Scala, getting them code-reviewed in Dublin. I felt happy that my first few contributions got the thumbs-up from the guys&ndash;that means I’m writing quality Scala code now. The other area I’m involved in is load testing, which we’re planning to develop as a platform so we can integrate it with the build-and-deploy, Ion-Cannon process.</span></p>
<p><strong>What do you like most about performance engineering?</strong></p>
<p><span>I like the impact that performance engineering has on other developers. Being in performance engineering means that you have to raise the bar and be at the forefront of quality. What we are about as a group is quality. The best tested code should be the one that does tests for others. </span></p>
<p><strong>How would you describe our performance engineering style?</strong></p>
<p><span>It&rsquo;s set up mostly so that the engineers can release early and often; it gives us the tool set that releases us from worry. It’s very important for a developer to be able to release when they feel like it, because it speeds up the development process while maintaining good quality. It also should lead&ndash;and does lead, most of the time&ndash;to innovation. If you’re not afraid to try new things because you’re confident that you’re not breaking everything, you can innovate faster. The <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/08/09/meet-a-gilt-technologist-roland-tritsch-vp" target="_blank">&ldquo;zero waiting&rdquo; concept</a></span><span> </span><span>that we&rsquo;re trying to develop frees up developers from being blocked by other people, or a lack of tools; here, we can do most of the things ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span>And with <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/06/07/virtualization-at-gilt-a-lightning-talk-for-nyc-devops" target="_blank">Galactica</a></span><span>, we’re trying to make our infrastructure as elastic as possible so that we no longer have to wait for things to become available. It&rsquo;s the same concept of zero waiting&ndash;you can get infrastructure on demand.</span></p>
<p><strong>What has your experience working with a transcontinental team been like?</strong></p>
<p><span>In late summer I visited NYC and met a lot of the team there; it’s very important to be able to put faces to names. I also spent some of my time there gauging interest in this log aggregation project we’re trying to create in Dublin. Having team members across the Atlantic is not difficult, as there is a lot of overlap in the work hours between Dublin and NYC.</span></p>
<p><strong>Tech-wise, what do you like to read?</strong></p>
<p><span>I follow several blogs and read magazines like </span><span><em>Wired</em>, <em>Linux Format </em></span><span>and</span><em> Mac Format</em><span>. I read mostly on my iPad&ndash;I commute to work by train now, and read a lot on the train.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are some of your goals at Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>The two projects I spoke about&ndash;3-6 months is the goal to get load testing integrated with the built system and get the log aggregation off the ground, to start pulling logs and integrating them. It has to go hand-in-hand with Galactica. I also want to learn more about Scala and sbt. It’s essential to have as much hands-on experience as possible.</span></p>
