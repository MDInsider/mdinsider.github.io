  <h1><a href="/2013/08/27/the-day-i-submitted-600-gerrit-reviews">The Day I Submitted 600 Gerrit Reviews</a></h1>
  
  <header>
    
    <time>27 August 2013</time>
    
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>It&rsquo;s well known that code review is an important tool for improving quality, and we use Gerrit extensively at Gilt for that purpose. But there are also some less obvious benefits of such tools.</p>
<p>With a system composed of hundreds of small services, applications, database schemas, libraries, and toolsets&ndash;each hosted in its own Git repository&ndash;maintaining certain standards across all of them is essential, but challenging. We may want to ensure that a certain configuration or other metadata is provided by each repo, for example. Or we might want to strongly encourage application developers to update a core library. Our tools for bootstrapping a new repository help us to make sure that current standards are followed, but it&rsquo;s easy for existing repositories to get out of date.</p>
<p>This is where Gerrit comes in: it becomes possible to run scripts against all of our repositories that propose a change of this sort then submit it to the owners of the repository to review. It would be irresponsible to blindly make such automated changes to all of our systems, and one individual can&rsquo;t realistically review every single repository&ndash;but by distributing the burden of the reviews out to the people most familiar with the system in question, we solve both of these problems.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s one prerequisite to doing this type of thing, which is that you need to know who the right people are to review changes to a given repository. We have a standard for this: a reviewers.yml file in the repository containing the information, and a Gerrit hook that adds reviewers to all new patch sets based on the contents. Now we just need to bootstrap these files with a guess at the right people. To do this, I ran the following shell script a couple days ago (for simplicity, I&rsquo;ve elided a few unimportant details):</p>
<pre>for project in `gg-gerrit-ls-projects`; do
    gg-gerrit-clone $project || continue
    cd $project

    yml="reviewers.yml"

    if [ ! -f $yml ] ; then
        reviewers=`git log -n 20 --pretty=tformat:%aE | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 3 | awk '{print $2}'`

        touch $yml
        echo "master:" &gt;&gt; $yml
        for r in $reviewers; do
            echo "  - $r" &gt;&gt; $yml
        done

        if git add $yml &amp;&amp; git commit -m "autopopulate reviewers.yml" &amp;&amp; git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master ; then

            changeid=`git show | grep Change-Id | head -n1 | cut -d: -f2`

            for r in $reviewers; do
                gg-gerrit-set-reviewer --add --name $r --project $project --changeid $changeid
            done
        fi
    fi
    cd ..
done
</pre>
<p>This runs through all of our projects, checks to see if the reviewers file exists, and, if it doesn&rsquo;t already, the script makes a guess that the top three authors from the past 20 commits are a reasonable set of reviewers. It then submits that as a patch set to Gerrit, and adds that same set of people as reviewers. (For the curious, the gg-gerrit-* commands are wrapper scripts to the Gerrit CLI.)</p>
<p>After a few days, the identified reviewers have already looked over and approved the submitted patches, sometimes with modifications. Because there were no potential negative consequences, I then ran another small shell script which also used the Gerrit CLI to find, approve, and submit the remaining ones. Six hundred repositories had been updated to a current standard&ndash;a feat which would have been nearly impossible without the freedom which code review gives us to make heuristic or speculative changes from automated tools and the power of the Gerrit command line interface.</p>

<p>This summer Gilt hosted Nikita and Diana, two aspiring technologists and participants in <a href="http://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a>&rsquo;s Summer Immersion Program. A NYC-based nonprofit, GWC strives to achieve gender parity in tech through their summer program, <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/07/19/girls-who-code-visit-gilt-tech" target="_blank">field trips to technology companies</a> and other initiatives. Nikita and Diana spent <span id="docs-internal-guid-39273982-bb85-e35b-ae80-d826a739e533">six weeks learning from Gilt technologists about software engineering practices, completing Gilt&rsquo;s API lessons on Codecademy, and receiving mentoring from engineers </span><span id="docs-internal-guid-39273982-bb85-e35b-ae80-d826a739e533"><span id="docs-internal-guid-39273982-bb87-a757-c536-0060f441d3d2">Nabila Yusaf and Ruxy Staicut. </span>At the end of the program, they gave a presentation on Gilterella, </span><span id="docs-internal-guid-39273982-bb86-b6a6-f89d-9b07ac32475d">a phone app they created using the Gilt public API. We expect very bright futures for both young women!<br/></span></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-488bc080-bb7e-1602-d64d-d670133d2dd7"><strong>How did you become involved in Girls Who Code?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong><span> My brother is a software engineer and emailed me about the program. It seemed pretty interesting since I enjoy working with computers/technology, so I signed up!</span></p>
<p><strong>Nikita</strong><span><strong>:</strong> My school’s summer bulletin is always filled with different opportunities. When I saw Girls Who Code on the list, I just had to sign up!</span></p>
<p id="docs-internal-guid-488bc080-bb7f-1f9e-a6f2-11c6cf25b4cc"><strong>Why did you become involved?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong><span> I’ve always liked technology. I even took AP Computer Science when I was a junior because it just seemed interesting. So when I realized that this was an opportunity to expand my knowledge and see what the tech world had to offer me, I was excited to be a part of it. </span></p>
<p><strong>Nikita</strong><span><strong>:</strong> I love working with technology. In the summer after eighth grade, I was a part of Google CAPE, where I was first introduced to computer science and how a huge company like Google is run. A year later, I took a Java course at ID Tech in NYU. When I heard about Girls Who Code, I realized that this was the perfect opportunity for me to delve into computer science and experience the tech world first-hand.</span></p>
<p><strong>Which areas of technology do you think you might study or consider as a career?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong><span> I’m an incoming college freshman this fall! I will be majoring in Computer Science. I’ve always wanted to be a computer programmer. The idea of making things that work and that people use is so awesome!!</span></p>
<p><strong>Nikita</strong><span><strong>:</strong> I am a rising high school senior. I am planning on majoring in Computer Science in college. I am also interested in studying Machine Learning/Data Analysis.</span></p>
<p><strong>Did you decide to come to Gilt, or were you assigned to Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong><span> Nikita and I were hunting for some tech internships this summer, and with help from Girls Who Code we got the opportunity to spend it here. </span></p>
<p><strong>Nikita</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Last summer, through Girls Who Code, we had a chance to visit Gilt. Both of us instantly fell in love with the company. I actually remember telling Kristen [Titus, </span><span><span><span>GWC </span></span>executive director</span><span>] that I knew I wanted to work at Gilt this summer. Of course, it was only a dream at the time. Both Kristen and Ashley [Gavin, GWC curriculum developer] helped make it possible for us to come here.</span></p>
<p><strong>Is this your first time working in an office? How is it different from attending high school classes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong><span> This is not my first time working in an office! Last year, Girls Who Code was located in the offices of AppNexus. Office life is EXTREMELY different. I’m having a lot of fun being in an actual work environment&ndash;it’s much more motivating than a high school classroom. I’m currently surrounded by people who have the careers that could possibly be mine in a couple of years. It gives me the advantage that most kids my age don’t have. Going to the office gives one a sense of responsibility, even though we have more freedom here than in high school (especially when it comes to punctuality and lunch breaks). </span></p>
<p><strong>Nikita</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Technically, I spent a summer at Google when I was a part of Google CAPE and last summer at AppNexus with Girls Who Code. However, this is the first time I am a part of the real working environment at a tech company. I have to say, this has definitely set my standard high as far as jobs go. I really love it here. Everyone is super welcoming and our mentors, Ruxy and Nabila, have taught us so much about programming and the company itself. </span></p>
<p><span>It’s completely different from attending high school classes because it’s hands-on and we have dived straight into the Gilterella project</span><span>&ndash;and, along the way, have asked for help. There is more freedom here and a lot more responsibility on ourselves. The classes that we took here are a lot more fun than school classes because we get to see how things work and how computer science is applied to real life and the real company.</span></p>
<p><strong>What have you learned here?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nikita</strong><span><strong>:</strong> At Gilt, we have taken a few courses a week taught by technologists who specialize in topics ranging from Data Analysis to Quality Assurance. I have learned that there are many different teams that work on different aspects of technology, ranging from mobile development to web, and how they all come together to produce great results. It has been interesting to see how someone working in QA might address certain issues with the Gilt website via JIRA, and how someone all the way across the office might be working on fixing it. </span></p>
<p><span>Personally, I have really improved my JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and jQuery skills, and I’ve even learned how to create a server. [Diana and I] have been working on Gilterella, which incorporates the Gilt API and a weather API in order to put together a </span><span>magical</span><span> outfit for users with certain preferences.</span></p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong><span> Gilterella returns an outfit based on the weather of the day you would wear it. </span></p>
<p><span>These past few weeks has helped me envision my future as a programmer. Not only have I become better at coding, but I’ve discovered the different areas of Gilt Tech that I could be a part of. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Which of the courses were your favorites?</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Diana:</span><span> My favorite course had to be “Gilt Security.&ldquo; My second favorite was “MVC, the Web, and HTTP.&rdquo; Both topics were extremely fascinating to me. </span></p>
<p><strong>Nikita</strong><span><strong>:</strong> My favorite courses were the ones about data analysis. I really enjoyed the Data Science class and Machine Learning.</span></p>
<p><strong>Have you been able to apply what you learned here to some of your own personal projects?</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Diana:</strong> </span><span>The lessons that we’ve had here at Gilt have been useful in our development of our Gilterella application. Also, the things I’ve learned here will apply to the courses I will take in college. </span></p>
<p><strong>Nikita</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Most of what we learned here was to aid us in the process of working on Gilterella. However, I know that when I leave I will be taking all the skills and knowledge that I gained here with me. It will definitely enable me to work on projects on my own in the future.</span><br/><span></span></p>
<p><strong>What did you learn about yourself here?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diana: </strong><span>Being here has taught me that with hard work and lots of practice I can have a career that I love. I’ve learned that I can wake up at 6 AM to get ready and commute to work. I’ve also learned that I have enough dedication to continue working even when I am completely frustrated.</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Nikita</strong><span><strong>:</strong> I learned that I can become a computer scientist,</span><span> and that I want to work at a tech company in the near future. Also, I really like the combination of fashion with computer science because it’s something that you don’t see very often and it’s very innovative. The environment here at Gilt has inspired me to want to come back. The people here are so friendly and outgoing and the work itself is something I know I would love to do.</span></p>
<p><strong>Did being at Gilt help you formulate ideas about the type of environment you’d like to work in when you get a job?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong><span> Gilt highly impacted what type of work environment I’d like to end up in. The diversity and atmosphere at Gilt is definitely different from anywhere I’ve worked. I would love to work in a place that combines tech and fashion. </span></p>
<p><strong>Nikita</strong><span><strong>:</strong> Gilt has definitely influenced what type of working environment I want to be in when I get a job. I want to be surrounded by hard-working, quirky people who are all focused on doing well but aren’t afraid to have some fun. I want to work at a company like Gilt, or even try and come back to Gilt because of its combination of fashion and tech. I want to be challenged and work somewhere where I can learn new things every day.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are your tech-related goals for the next year?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Diana:</strong><span> After my work here at Gilt I definitely see myself participating in a hackathon and applying to other internships in tech companies. I’m looking forward to advancing my coding skills in other places, and even applying what I’ve learned here to projects in my CS class at college.  </span></p>
<p><strong>Nikita</strong><span><strong>:</strong> I am hoping to teach myself how to code in Ruby and Python with help from the Codecademy lessons that we were introduced to us here at Gilt. I would actually really enjoy participating in a hackathon. I’ve seen the results of hackathons before (people come up with really cool things under pressure) but I have never really been a part of one. I also want to work on using what I learned here to teach others and bring the skills I gained to GWC&rsquo;s XX Hackers (programming) club, which I run at my school.</span></p>

<p>As part of our efforts to give back to New York City’s vibrant tech community, we’ve begun offering free programming help sessions at our Manhattan office. For fellow enthusiasts of Scala and the Typesafe platform, we’ve launched <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Hacker-Hours/" target="_blank">Scala Hacker Hours NYC</a>; for the iPhone-adoring crowd, we’ve partnered up with the team at Code Coalition to co-organize <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-iOS-Office-Hours/" target="_blank">iOS Office Hours</a>. Both groups meet every other week from 6:30 to 8:30 PM and feature at least one or two participants from our engineering team, who answer attendees&rsquo; questions and talk about our technologies.</p>
<p>We’d love to take credit for the <a href="denied:%E2%80%9Dhttp://hackerhours.org/%E2%80%9D" target="_blank">Hacker Hours</a> concept, but we can’t. That privilege goes to <a href="http://api.afeld.me" target="_blank">Aidan Feldman</a>: a developer at the online art platform Artsy, JavaScript instructor at NYU, and (when he’s not coding or showing others how to code) professional dancer. After graduating from the University of Michigan a few years ago, Aidan moved to NYC and started his first full-time developer job. To find his way around his new hometown and its lively tech scene, he began attending hackathons and meetups. Along the way, he kept running into people who were trying to teach themselves how to code.</p>
<p>“I had always assumed that most people who wanted to get serious about programming went through the traditional four-year program like I did,” he says. “I couldn&rsquo;t imagine trying to learn this stuff without having classmates and instructors around for help and guidance.”</p>
<p>Aidan was doing a bit of one-on-one tutoring on the side, but that instructional format started to seem limiting and inefficient. What if he made himself available to a whole group of people at one time? Then he could provide feedback and help people to get past hurdles so they could work through the rest of their projects or exercises on their own time. This realization inspired him to create Hacker Hours.</p>
<p>The first Hacker Hours took place at Aidan’s then-workplace in a conference room that held eight people. To promote the meetup, he announced it on his blog and some local mailing lists. When the time came, he wasn’t sure how many people would actually show up. “I sat there by myself for the first hour and a half and was ready to give up,” he recalls, “but then a single person walked in. We talked through the bug he was having, and he was so grateful, that it gave me just enough confidence to do it again.” The next Hacker Hours drew four people; the one after that, eight people, then the next, a dozen. “Every time since, more than 15 people have attended.”</p>
<p>The crowds at those first few Hacker Hours meetups were almost exclusively absolute beginners, Aidan says. “They’d line up with questions, and I&rsquo;d run around frantically trying to get to everyone.” Growing attendance required him to move the gatherings to a NYC coffee shop. With the change of scenery came a change in the group’s vibe. “Now, we get a lot of regulars and a mix of skill levels, so it&rsquo;s as much about the co-working and community as about the help.”</p>

<p><em>Hacking at Hacker Hours. Image credit: Aidan Feldman.</em></p>
<p>In Midtown Manhattan, Aidan holds <a href="http://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/" target="_blank">Hacker Hours</a> every Sunday at the AlleyNYC co-working space. Former Hacker Hours regular Karl Baum has also started organizing them on weekdays, and a variety of language/framework-specific office hours (including ours) have popped up across the city. The concept has spread west of the Hudson River: there’s now a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Hacker-Hours-Boulder/" target="_blank">Hacker Hours Boulder</a>, and other groups are forming nationwide. To help aspiring organizers get started, Aidan has created a <a href="https://github.com/afeld/hackerhours.org/wiki/DIY-Guide" target="_blank">Hacker Hours guide</a> with advice and tips. The guide is open source so that other organizers can share their ideas for alternate formats and tweaks.</p>
<p>Spending so much time helping others learn how to code has its advantages. In addition to meeting people who are similarly passionate about programming and technology, Aidan has also met some of his best friends via Hacker Hours. “I benefit a great deal from the work of others, through attending their talks and using their open-source software, so this is my main way of paying it forward,” he says. “I also think that having more and better developers in the industry benefits everyone, so that we can spend less time reading recruiter emails and more time building stuff.” Networking and notoriety—“writ small, of course”—are other pluses. “My long-term personal goal is to become the Neil deGrasse Tyson of coding, and explaining concepts to beginners helps me to clarify my assumptions.”</p>
<p>How should people prepare to attend a Hacker Hours event? Help the group’s mentors (anyone who’s willing to answer questions) help you by bringing specific questions, Aidan suggests: “Even if those questions are on the order of, ‘what should I learn first?’ or ‘what&rsquo;s a good resource for X?’” Picking a goal is also advisable. “There&rsquo;s a big difference in what you need to know in order to tweak a WordPress theme, versus how to get a full-time job as a developer. Both are perfectly valid, but require different sets of skills.&ldquo;</p>

<p id="docs-internal-guid-6e68607a-9c86-ea6d-95f8-b0dd09189c6c"><strong>How did you get to Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>I grew up in the Bay Area, and for the majority of my career I’ve worked in Silicon Valley. Upon reflection&ndash;because I don’t think it was a conscious or deliberate choice&ndash;my career has followed a thread: technology, fashion, and ecommerce. </span></p>
<p><span>Three years ago, I moved from the Bay Area to NYC. In considering places where I might work, I focused on ecommerce because I knew it was something I was passionate about. </span></p>
<p><strong>Tell us how you got into user experience.</strong></p>
<p><span>Years ago, I basically got into what was then called Information Architecture. A lot of people see IA as the genesis of what eventually became User Experience. At the time, the company I was working for began to embrace the Internet&ndash;first for employee communications, then for commerce. I taught myself a little HTML, a little graphic design, and invented the Web Designer position at the bricks-and-mortar retailer where I was working. That experience became my first exposure to ecommerce, and I&rsquo;ve been hooked ever since. </span></p>
<p><span>It was at an agency where I got to truly specialize in IA as a discipline, and that catapulted me into UX design. </span></p>
<p><strong>Why Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>Gilt represented the best of what the NYC tech scene had to offer, and even today people consider us to be the leader in the flash sales space, with great leadership and talent. It’s a very attractive place to work, and I have since come to learn that it’s the people that make working at Gilt so special. We’ve attracted the best and brightest from the area and beyond because of the strength of the brand and our leadership position. We’re a great place for super-smart, motivated people to work. </span></p>
<p><strong>What was your first role here?</strong></p>
<p><span>I joined the company in 2011 as a Principal UX Designer. In addition to leading UX strategy and design for my project team, I served as a team mentor and an evangelist for UX to the rest of organization.</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>In your two years here, how has UX at Gilt evolved?</strong></p>
<p><span>Because of our heritage&ndash;flash, a sense of urgency, curation, the gamification of shopping, the thrill of the hunt&ndash;we traditionally emphasized simplicity, speed, and fun. If you think about trying to replicate an offline sample sale, I think we delivered on those tenets. We created an experience that allowed the products we offer to take center stage and be the stars. In addition to making it super easy and quick to shop, the UX has evolved to make the Gilt experience enjoyable and engaging, to strike a balance between functionality and aesthetics, and to help you find what you love while having a good time.</span><br/><span></span><br/><span></span><strong>One of the biggest initiatives your team has worked on this year is Gilt Insider. Tell us about that.</strong></p>
<p><span>From a customer experience standpoint, our high-level goals centered on a few basic questions: How can we attract, entice and engage customers? How can we incentivize them to spend more time on our site? And how can we inspire them to consider us over the competition, and differentiate ourselves from the competition? With these questions in mind, we created Gilt Insider, which made us the first flash sale site to offer a true points-based loyalty program. </span></p>
<p><span>Gilt Insider rewards our customers for all the ways they interact with the brand. Customers can earn points for purchasing items, referring friends, and even for just visiting the site. They can redeem their points to shop sales early, gain access to discounts and free shipping, attend exclusive events, and more.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/96e11a151a1550b19a53b2729f75c33c/tumblr_inline_mrudjpXbiL1qz4rgp.png"/></span></p>

<p><strong>What were some of the UX considerations that came into play when creating Insider?</strong></p>
<p><span>Senior UX Designer David Park, who led the UX planning for Gilt Insider, thought a lot about all of our different customer touch points and where in the experience Insider fit best. He also considered how to bring the perks and benefits to life, which led to a beautifully designed Insider dashboard.</span></p>
<p><strong>How does the UX team make decisions?</strong></p>
<p><span>We rely on a combination of quantitative and qualitative information to help inform our design decisions: user research, data and analytics, along with our experience and instincts.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the things I love about UX design is that it isn&rsquo;t an exact science, and that there isn&rsquo;t necessarily a right or wrong answer&ndash;just different, and perhaps better, ways to lead your user on the customer experience journey.</span></p>
<p><strong>How do initiatives like Gilt Insider come to fruition?</strong></p>
<p><span>As the product manager responsible for overseeing an initiative starts to flesh out the “Why,” he or she will lean on the UX team to determine the &ldquo;How&rdquo;: what it means for the customer experience, and what it might look like. The most successful Product Manager/UX Designer relationships are highly collaborative partnerships where each party has a strong sense of ownership.</span></p>
<p><strong>What do you enjoy most about UX at Gilt?</strong></p>
<p><span>I’ve definitely enjoyed the willingness to try things and take risks. Removing constraints, at least initially, frees up your thinking and lets you experiment. It&rsquo;s also been a pleasure working alongside the caliber of developer talent that we have. Our engineers have the ability to deliver the fit and finish to the product that, while sometimes small in detail, matter greatly to the overall experience. Because our engineers are using the latest technologies, we&rsquo;re able to bring to life ideas and experiences that might not otherwise be possible.</span></p>
<p><strong>Does Gilt UX follow a particular set of guiding principles?</strong></p>
<p><span>Yes&ndash;it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve been working on, though they&rsquo;re more internally focused. We&rsquo;ve discussed how these UX principles might roll up into larger experience pillars that perhaps could be public-facing&ndash;something akin to Google&rsquo;s “Ten Things We Know To Be True,” or Facebook&rsquo;s “Design Principles.”</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Your team is looking for a senior-level UX designer. What sort of person would flourish here?</strong></p>
<p><span>The kind of UX Designer who will be successful at Gilt is someone who isn’t content to just be told what to do. They’re very much about contributing ideas, suggesting new things, and pointing out the possibilities. It’s very much a partnership, because UX isn’t just about me drawing something up and telling the rest of the team to go do it. We feed off each other’s creativity to come up with the best ideas. </span></p>
<p><span>We’re looking to add someone who will help us continue to evangelize for and drive a customer-centric approach to design. We really see ourselves as the voice of the customer from an experience point of view. </span><span></span></p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>We all have a lot to do. Effective time/task management is essential. I&rsquo;ve been using GTD (Getting Things Done) for a while now (a long while :)) and for me it comes down to the question, &ldquo;How do you pick the next, best, most valuable thing to work on?&rdquo;&ndash;basically answering the question of how to make the best use of the time you have.</p>
<p>Picking something from your list of urgent things to do is kind of easy, but how can you make sure you are not missing the opportunity/chance to work on something important, if you get the chance to do so?</p>
<p>For me, picking something from my important list comes down to two questions:</p>
<ul><li>How much time do I have? Ten minutes? Thirty minutes? An hour?</li>
<li>Do I need other people to help me, or can I make progress on my own?</li>
</ul><p>Doing something short on my own is easy. In general, it means that I try to pick a task that requires other people to be available and that takes a long time (an hour or more).</p>

Nearly 40 data divas and data dudes from JP Morgan, the New York Public Library, MTV, AOL and other companies turned out to hear Elon <span class="full"><span>discuss how and why he created an <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2013/07/11/making-cents-of-census-data" target="_blank">open data file</a> that aggregates U.S. Census and American Community Survey data to the zip code level. Also making a strong showing: Gilt&rsquo;s Data team, who contributed additional insights and wry commentary.<br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class="full"><span>Thanks to </span></span><span class="full"><span><span class="full"><span>Kaitlin Atkinson and Jacki Buros, </span></span>DataDivas&rsquo; energetic and super-friendly organizers, for inviting Gilt to present&ndash;and to last night&rsquo;s audience, for making the follow-up Q&amp;A so lively and informative!</span></span></p>
