<p>It turns out, naming things is really hard (one of the two <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank">hard things in computer science</a>). When we went to name our project, pressed for time, we went for the most topical thing we could think of at the time. Thus, <code>charlie_sheen_service</code> was released to production at about 1 am.</p>
<p><code>charlie_sheen_service</code> has one endpoint, <code>blather</code> that is a live feed of orders with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Statistical_Area" target="_blank">MSA</a> data.</p>
<p>The service is polled by it’s one client, <strong>Warlock</strong>. Warlock is a map that displays the orders as the come in real-time. A marker shows where orders are coming from on the map, and as more come in the radius of the marker expands. As the average price of that MSA increase, the color of the marker changes. Images of the products are spewed forth from the map as they come in. The whole thing is <em>winning</em>.</p>
<p>Warlock is built in <a href="http://tech.gilt.com/2011/03/09/coffeescript" target="_blank">CoffeeScript</a> and a great JS library called <a href="http://polymaps.org/" target="_blank">Polymaps</a>.</p>
<p>It’s often displayed on a large monitor in our office.</p>

    <p>So far, the blog has been focusing on all the amazing work that goes on in Gilt Technologie, but we’d like to take a moment to write about something that makes working at Gilt truly great.  The people.  Specifically, the women.  ;-) <br/><br/>Here’s a glimpse into our fabulously diverse tech team by those of us brave enough to step up and say, “Hello world.” (Rock on Gilt Tech Divas!)<br/><br/><strong>Janice E. Bouley, Corp IT Support</strong><br/>Janice supports all aspects of software, hardware, computer-related issues, IP and cell phone issues, and helps to make sure everyone at our company can work smoothly from day to day.  She also supports all of our Gilt City locations and Jetsetter and does remote help and phone support.<br/><br/>When Janice is not at Gilt she enjoys traveling, partying, and doing art.  Her favorite place to travel so far has been Beijing, China, as she loves the culture, the food, and the sites!  Janice enjoys painting, drawing, graphic design, and printmaking, especially etching and photolithography.<br/><br/><strong>Sasha Villanueva, Executive Assistant to the CIO and CTO</strong><br/>Sasha was in the first 20 hires here at Gilt.  When she first started she was in the Marketing department, which at the time only consisted of 2 people.  From Marketing, Sasha started working with Michael Bryzek, where she was able to wear multiple hats in the office and distribution centers.  Currently Sasha is the admin for the technical department where she organizes all of the department’s logistics.<br/><br/>Sasha enjoys dance and travel, and was part of a semi-pro Salsa dance team that performed all over the country.<br/><br/><strong>Molly Sullan, QA Manager</strong><br/>Molly is QA Manager at Gilt, focusing on front end, mobile, marketing, business operations and PMO projects. Her team includes both on- and offshore testers, which has been fun and challenging. Molly coordinates their testing schedules, and works with the engineering team to resolve any issues that arise. We have releases almost daily, so there is always quite a bit of new code to look through - never a dull moment!  At her desk you’ll find a collection of My Little Ponies… which has been nicknamed “The Ranch.”<br/><br/>Before joining Gilt, Molly spent a year backpacking through South America and being a ski bum in Aspen, CO. She spends her non-Gilt time skiing, hiking, playing soccer and being outside.  <br/><br/><strong>Tracie Cheung, Project Manager</strong><br/>Tracie is a project manager at Gilt and has worked on projects from enabling drop ship to launching the Gilt Manual. There is rarely a dull moment in the work day and the days rarely ever look the same. While not working, Tracie can be found poring over fashion magazines and blogs. She enjoys trying her hand at new recipes, photography, reading books, running, volleyball and amazing coffee houses in NYC.<br/><br/>In high school, Tracie’s volleyball coach misspelled her last name on the team roster to “Chenug” and to this day some of her closest friends still refer to her as “Chenug” (which is much more fun to say than to read!)<br/><br/><strong>Kristen McGregor, Software Engineer</strong><br/>Kristen works on the engineering team at Gilt City coding both the front and backend for Gilt City and our Admin. She recently worked on the new admin calendar, and is currently working on a Gilt City redesign. Kristen loves the many components of the Gilt code, where she can work in Javascript one day and switch to a Postgres SQL statement the next.<br/><br/>Kristen was born in California, grew up in Maine, and spent a few years living in San Antonio, TX.  She just recently moved to the big apple from Boston.  Kristen has had a bowl of ice cream every night since Junior High, and she considers herself a french fry connoisseur!  In her spare time Kristen enjoys fine dining in NYC, reading, skiing in the winter, long walks in the summer, and yes, coding :).<br/><br/><strong>Angela Monaghan, Project Manager</strong><br/>Angela spends her time at Gilt working on Distribution, Reporting, Gilt MANual, and Email projects! Prior to Gilt, Angela worked at eFashion Solutions as the Tech Project Manager and the Director of Photo Studio Operations. During her time at eFashion Solutions, she managed the launch of nine e-commerce sites and the daily operations of twenty-two e-commerce sites.  <br/> <br/>Angela has an unhealthy addiction to Starbucks; you will rarely see her without a coffee in her hand.  Angela spends most of her non-Gilt time working off the extra Starbucks calories in a kickboxing class or snowboarding!<br/><br/><strong>Heather Fleming, PMO Director</strong><br/>Heather spends her day coordinating the various people and projects needed for Gilt while working to improve efficiency in communication and processes.  She is passionate about organizational culture and emotional intelligence and how these contribute to the overall success of an organization.<br/><br/>When not at Gilt, you can usually find Heather on the LIRR (her commute is 2 hours one-way!).  In her free time, Heather is typically chasing after a toddler, training for a 5K and studying everything there is to know about wine… especially touring and tasting on the North Fork of Long Island.<br/><br/></p>

    <p>Slides and video from Eric Shepherd’s presentation given at Gilt HQ and at the Brooklyn JavaScript Meetup:</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>For modules to function within a large-scale system and on third-party sites, they need to be self-contained units with minimal dependencies. They also need to keep their hands off of other modules and library code. Gilt’s module framework manages multiple independent components, providing them with what they need, and only what they need, to do their jobs.</p>
<p>Once the module framework is built, third parties still need an easy way to consume modules. A server-generated JavaScript bootstrap file allows all the module’s options to be wrapped in a closure, keeping the DOM clean and conflict-free. There are some complex problems that arise when embedding code this way, so be sure to watch for them!</p>

    <p>CNN stopped by Gilt HQ to cover our first Hackathon of 2011. The 24-hour hacking extravaganza produced more than a dozen ideas. Features included using your iPhone’s camera to find products that coordinate with the color of anything you point it at, to umbrella sales that activate when it starts raining near you.</p>

CoffeeScript is a simple language with syntactic roots in Python and Ruby. It compiles into JavaScript and adds interesting features including array comprehensions. CoffeeScript is arguably more readable than JavaScript.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Jeremy gave a great overview of CoffeeScript and who is using it. He gets into detail on the Syntax of the language and also discusses its implementation and how to go about creating your own language.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><u><span>Cautionary Tale Told By My Friend</span></u></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The QSA walked into the conference room, sat down and took out a thick beige folder labeled “PCI.&ldquo; She looked uneasy as she started going down the list of questions from top-to-bottom:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span><span>- “Umm okay, requirement 8.1. Identify all users with a unique user name … Do you do that?” she asked.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span><span>- “Yes, we do. However in a few cases we have to use generic accounts in our legacy systems. Access to these generic accounts is restricted and carefully audited.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>- “That’s no good. You have to re-architect your legacy systems,&rdquo; she replied.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>She took out a gum and started chewing, staring intently while waiting for the response. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>At that point my friend (and a fellow CISO at an online retailer) paused and nervously sipped his tea. The next day he called the QSA’s manager and she was taken off the project. He had to search for a new QSA.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><u><span>What is PCI?</span></u></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The PCI DSS (payment card industry data security standard) was created by a consortium of credit card companies to enforce a set of minimum security standards. If your company accepts credit cards as a form of payment, then it must comply with the PCI standard. Companies who are Level 1 merchants (processing over 6 million Visa transactions annually) must undergo an onsite data security assessment by a QSA (qualified security assessor) who signs off on their PCI compliance status. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Unfortunately, many organizations view PCI compliance as a “necessary evil” and aim to get it over with as quickly as possible. They will hire the first QSA that comes along who is going to check off the boxes in the PCI questionnaire and give a stamp of approval. Many smaller companies who are not Level 1 merchants are eager not to hire a QSA to save money since they are not obligated to do so. These are all crucial mistakes. You want to use PCI compliance to tighten the security in your company, and you don’t want a QSA to let you off easy. You want your QSA to be knowledgeable, fair and impartial.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span><strong><u><span>The Five Questions You Need To Ask</span></u></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Before hiring a QSA, make sure you obtain as much information as possible about him. So before letting him come in and grill you, turn the tables around and interview your QSA.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We now list the five questions that you can’t hire your QSA without asking:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span><strong><span>1. Can you show me your CV?</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>A good QSA needs to have sufficient security and technical skills to effectively perform the audit. Just understanding the PCI DSS specification is not enough. The best QSAs will have a background in Information Security and experience working as a penetration tester, risk analyst or a CISO. This background will enable them to make tough judgment calls, assess if your firewall configurations are correct, and understand if your compensating controls are sufficient.<span>  </span>Note that you can verify the QSA’s standing at the following link: <a href="http://bit.ly/bomYyZ" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/bomYyZ</a> . </span><span>Also, you can use this link <span><a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/pci_qsa_list.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pdfs/pci_qsa_list.pdf</a> to check QSA </span>companies which have at least one QSA who failed to perform an adequate PCI DSS assessment<span>.</span></span><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span><strong><span>2. What types of companies have you provided assessments for?</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Make sure that the QSA you hire has performed PCI audits of companies in your line of business and knows the challenges that they face.<span>   </span>If you are in an e-commerce business, selling luxury goods online, and the QSA has only dealt with large financial services firms, he may not be the right guy for the job.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>3. <strong>What is your stance on compensating controls?</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The goal here is to eliminate QSAs who read the requirements verbatim. The only requirement written in stone is requirement 3.2 (Do not store sensitive authentication data subsequent to authorization).<span>   </span>All other requirements need to convey intent. <span> </span>For example, it’s perfectly ok to use a compensating control if you can’t assign a unique ID to every user (requirement 8.2) as long as you document and monitor all generic, shared IDs. A good QSA will understand that, while a bad one will force you to waste valuable time re-architecting your system without making it secure just to meet the requirement verbatim. When you interview a QSA, don’t be afraid to dig in further - give a concrete scenario where your company had to use a compensating control and see how the QSA reacts. <span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>4<strong>. How much do you charge, and what are the deliverables at the end of the engagement?</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The best QSAs are usually employed by the best QSA companies and they do not come cheap. Be wary of selecting a security vendor, who also happens to do PCI audits on the side, just to save a few bucks. A simple PCI audit which lasts a few weeks onsite will cost you $20K-$30K. More extensive PCI audits will cost on the order of $100K.<span>  </span>So if you have allocated low budget towards a PCI audit, you are setting yourself up for failure.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>There are two types of services which QSAs usually offer:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>       </span></span></span><strong><span>Gap analysis (a.k.a a PCI preparedness exam):</span></strong><span> A QSA will assess how prepared you are for the PCI audit. He will advise you on what remains to be done, and what controls you may need to change to pass the audit. The results of a gap analysis are not reported.</span><span> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>-<span>       </span></span></span><strong><span>PCI audit:</span></strong><span> This is the real thing, where a QSA will request documentation, interview appropriate personnel, and assess your controls. At the end of the audit, you should expect to receive an IROC (initial report on compliance). You will have roughly 4 months to remediate any found gaps, after which you will receive a final ROC (report on compliance). </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> 5<strong>. Will you be available throughout the year in case we have any questions?</strong></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>PCI compliance represents a point in time and not a permanent state of being. You will have to maintain PCI compliance throughout the year and naturally questions may arise. You want to stay in touch with your QSA auditor, maintain a good relationship, and hopefully hire him to come back the following year.<span>  </span>So if your QSA tells you that he is planning a two-year vacation to Hawaii or that you need to route all questions through his company’s support line, run away!</span></p>

  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>At Gilt, we&rsquo;ve stumbled into something we internally call the Rule of 4:<br/><br/>Q: How many servers should we have for this new app?<br/>A: 4<br/><br/>Q: How many partitions should we split our inventory into?<br/>A: 4<br/><br/>Q: How many nodes should the cart KV store run on?<br/>A: 4<br/><br/>Why 4?<br/><br/>One is not a good idea - building for 1 makes it hard to expand later (e.g. imagine building a service that runs on a single node&hellip; it usually takes a lot of work later to modify the service to run on 2 nodes).<br/><br/>Two is better, but still leads to assumptions designed into the code as opposed to configuration.<br/><br/>Three generally works well. By the time an application is built to run on 3 nodes, the node information usually has moved to configuration and services that run on 3 nodes tend to be easy to expand.<br/><br/>So why 4? Our early systems were provisioned in groups of 4 based on load estimates&hellip; and worked great. We found that 4 servers was enough for many of the applications / servers we create at Gilt (not every application gets hammered at noon). With four servers, we can safely ramp up traffic for new applications, get real world metrics on performance based on a percentage of site traffic, and then decide how many actual servers we will need to support the full traffic of the site.</p>

  <h1><a href="/2011/02/15/gilt-template">Gilt's JavaScript Templating Architecture</a></h1>
  
  <header>
    
    <time>15 February 2011</time>
    
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Templating is a powerful way of separating concerns on the front end. It’s a natural fit for Gilt’s platform, since much of our content comes to the front end from services that return JSON. Sometimes that JSON is rendered in JSPs with JSTL, but sometimes it’s better to render it with JavaScript.</p>

<p>Until recently, most JavaScript HTML rendering involved messy string concatenation, lots of looping, and an unholy marriage of logic and content in the same file. However, new templating engines, such as <a href="https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js" target="_blank">Handlebars</a>, allow multiple logic-less templates to be created for the same content, with clean, easy-to-read syntax. Compare:</p>

<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/826338.js" type="text/javascript"></script></p>

<p>But which template engine to use? There are many currently vying for prominence. I didn’t want to hitch our wagon to any one engine, since many different pieces of Gilt code need to make templating calls and none of us knows the future, so I decided to create a middle-tier API that would accept any templating engine as a plugin. This is generally a good way to approach front end architecture, as it’s all too easy to scatter third-party dependencies throughout a large codebase, leading to difficult maintenance and requiring significant restructuring if the third-party code ever needs to be changed.</p>

<p><strong>What It Is</strong></p>

<p>There are three components in addition to the implementation code:</p>

<ul><li><code>Gilt.Template</code>, which exposes <code>render()</code>, <code>register()</code>, <code>plugin.add()</code> and <code>plugin.get()</code> methods</li>
<li>a template file saved using a directory and file naming convention</li>
<li>the chosen rendering engine code</li>
</ul><p><strong>How It Works</strong></p>

<ol><li>Templates are stored in a <code>Gilt.Template</code> private cache, by a unique combination of name, engine, and version. Name is typically the type of feed or data that is being rendered, such as a wait list, a single product feed, or a cart. Version indicates which view of the data is required (“default” is the canonical view, and views can exist for third-party sites or other areas on the Gilt site such as a modal window or a specific page). Engine indicates which third-party rendering to use, with Handlebars as the default if none is specified.</li>
<li>For flexibility, all rendering is asynchronous. The <code>render()</code> method does not actually write any markup; instead, it supplies the rendered markup to a passed callback function. This allows the template file or rendering engine to be lazy loaded at the time of invocation, rather than be already present on the page, and it recognizes that often the rendered template is needed for purposes other than writing immediately into an element on a page.</li>
<li>Each template engine is an equal citizen, registered as a plugin with <code>Gilt.Template</code>. <a href="https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js" target="_blank">Handlebars</a> and <a href="http://akdubya.github.com/dustjs/" target="_blank">Dust</a> are built-in, as we use both of them on the Gilt site; however, any additional template engine can be registered and used. Each plugin must provide a <code>render()</code> method, and optionally can provide a <code>register()</code> method (used, for example, in Dust compilation). When the implementation code calls <code>Gilt.Template.render()</code>, that method delegates to the plugin’s <code>render()</code> method.</li>
<li>If the template is not available in <code>Gilt.Template</code>&rsquo;s cache, it triggers an asynchronous load of the template file, looking by a naming convention of <code>/templates/&lt;type&gt;/&lt;version&gt;.&lt;engine&gt;.js</code>. For example, a template that handles the default view of a wait list feed using Handlebars would be stored at <code>/templates/wait_list/default.handlebars.js</code>. This convention allows for multiple views of the same data feed. <code>Gilt.Template.render()</code> takes an optional argument for an ajax service to use, with jQuery used by default. This allows for the possibility of use with a different base library, since this is the only point of third-party dependency.</li>
</ol><p><strong>How To Use</strong></p>

<p>So, the three steps required to use the system are:</p>

<ol><li>
<p>Add a plugin using <code>Gilt.Template.plugin.add()</code> with the specific code required to interact with the chosen third-party templating engine. Handlebars support is built-in and, for reference, looks like this:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/826350.js" type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[

// ]]></script></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Register a template with <code>Gilt.Template.register()</code>, indicating a unique combination of name, engine, and version. This could be done prior to calling <code>render()</code>; if not, <code>render()</code> will lazy load this template file, thereby calling <code>register()</code>:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/826353.js" type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[

// ]]></script></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call <code>Gilt.Template.render()</code>, passing it the unique name, engine, and version to render, along with a callback to be provided with HTML. The <code>render()</code> method will load the plugin and call <code>register()</code> first if the template is unavailable. The following code is probably in the callback of an ajax request function:</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/826355.js" type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[

// ]]></script></p>
</li>
</ol><p><strong>tl;dr;</strong></p>

<p>In summary, <code>Gilt.Template</code>:</p>

<ul><li>allows for template storage by engine, version and name;</li>
<li>provides flexibility by providing rendered markup to a callback function;</li>
<li>treats all templating engines equally; and</li>
<li>speeds up page load by asynchronously loading template files.</li>
</ul><p>Templates have helped us to separate our content data from its views on the site, and our middle-tier architecture has provided a consistent API and eliminated the need for third-party calls in the Gilt codebase.</p>
